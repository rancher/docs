:::caution

The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see [Installation](installation-and-upgrade.md).

Use this section of the docs to jump start your deployment and testing of Rancher 2.x. It contains instructions for a simple Rancher setup and some common use cases. We plan on adding more content to this section in the future.

We have Quick Start Guides for:

- [Deploying Rancher Server](deploy-rancher-manager.md): Get started running Rancher using the method most convenient for you.

- [Deploying Workloads](deploy-rancher-workloads.md): Deploy a simple [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) and expose it, letting you access it from outside the cluster.
