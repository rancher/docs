In this section, you'll learn how to set up a vSphere cloud provider for a Rancher managed RKE Kubernetes cluster in vSphere.

# In-tree Cloud Provider

To use the in-tree vSphere cloud provider, you will need to use an RKE configuration option. For details, refer to [this page.](../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/set-up-cloud-providers/vsphere/configure-in-tree-vsphere.md)

# Out-of-tree Cloud Provider

To set up the out-of-tree vSphere cloud provider, you will need to install Helm charts from the Rancher marketplace. For details, refer to [this page.](../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/set-up-cloud-providers/vsphere/configure-out-of-tree-vsphere.md)
