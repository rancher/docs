### Fleet

Rancher v2.5 introduced Fleet, a new way to deploy applications across clusters.

Fleet is GitOps at scale. For more information, refer to the [Fleet section.](../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/deploy-apps-across-clusters/fleet.md)

### Multi-cluster Apps

In Rancher before v2.5, the multi-cluster apps feature was used to deploy applications across clusters. The multi-cluster apps feature is deprecated, but still available in Rancher v2.5.

Refer to the documentation [here.](../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/deploy-apps-across-clusters/multi-cluster-apps.md)
