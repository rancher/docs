To get up and running with Rancher quickly, we have included a **Getting Started** section.

The goal of this section is to be able to assist users in deploying Rancher and workloads and to install or upgrade Rancher quickly and effectively.

Please see the [introduction], [quick start guides], and the [installation and upgrade] sections for more.
