title: Getting Started
---

To get up and running with Rancher quickly, we have included a **Getting Started** section.

The goal of this section is to be able to assist users in deploying Rancher and workloads and to install or upgrade Rancher quickly and effectively.

Please see the [introduction](../docs/pages-for-subheaders/introduction.md), [quick start guides](../docs/pages-for-subheaders/quick-start-guides.md), and the [installation and upgrade](../docs/pages-for-subheaders/installation-and-upgrade.md) sections for more.
