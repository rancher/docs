## Running for development/editing

The `rancher/docs:dev` docker image runs a live-updating server.  To run on your workstation, run:

Linux
```bash
  ./scripts/dev
```

Windows
```powershell
./scripts/dev-windows.ps1
```

and then navigate to http://localhost:9001/. Click the link on the card associated with a given Rancher version to
access the documentation. For example, clicking on the link of the Rancher v2.5 card will redirect to
http://localhost:9001/rancher/v2.5/en/. Note that due to the way the Rancher website is built, links in the top
navigation panel will not work.

You can customize the port by passing it as an argument:

Linux
```bash
  ./scripts/dev 8080
```

Windows
```powershell
./scripts/dev-windows.ps1 -port 8080
```
