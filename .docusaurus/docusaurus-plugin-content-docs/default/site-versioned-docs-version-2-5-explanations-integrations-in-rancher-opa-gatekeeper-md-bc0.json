  "description": "To ensure consistency and compliance, every organization needs the ability to define and enforce policies in its environment in an automated way. OPA (Open Policy Agent) is a policy engine that facilitates policy-based control for cloud native environments. Rancher provides the ability to enable OPA Gatekeeper in Kubernetes clusters, and also installs a couple of built-in policy definitions, which are also called constraint templates.",
