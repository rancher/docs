By default, RKE will launch etcd servers, but RKE also supports being able to use an external etcd. RKE only supports connecting to a TLS enabled etcd setup.

> **Note:** RKE will not accept having external etcd servers in conjunction with [nodes]({{< baseurl >}}/rke/latest/en/config-options/nodes/) with the `etcd` role.

```yaml
services:
    etcd:
      path: /etcdcluster
      external_urls:
        - https://etcd-example.com:2379
      ca_cert: |-
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        xxxxxxxxxx
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      cert: |-
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        xxxxxxxxxx
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      key: |-
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        xxxxxxxxxx
        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## External etcd Options

### Path

The `path` defines the location of where the etcd cluster is on the endpoints.

### External URLs

The `external_urls` are the endpoints of where the etcd cluster is hosted. There can be multiple endpoints for the etcd cluster.

### CA Cert/Cert/KEY

The certificates and private keys used to authenticate and access the etcd service.
