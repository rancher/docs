title: Network Plug-ins
weight: 261
---

RKE provides the following network plug-ins that are deployed as add-ons:

- Flannel
- Calico
- Canal
- Weave

> **Note:** After you launch the cluster, you cannot change your network provider. Therefore, choose which network provider you want to use carefully, as Kubernetes doesnâ€™t allow switching between network providers. Once a cluster is created with a network provider, changing network providers would require you tear down the entire cluster and all its applications.

By default, the network plug-in is `canal`. If you want to use another network plug-in, you need to specify which network plug-in to enable at the cluster level in the `cluster.yml`.

```yaml
# Setting the flannel network plug-in
network:
    plugin: flannel
```

The images used for network plug-ins are under the [`system_images` directive]({{< baseurl >}}/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/). For each Kubernetes version, there are default images associated with each network plug-in, but these can be overridden by changing the image tag in `system_images`.

# Disabling Deployment of a Network Plug-in

You can disable deploying a network plug-in by specifying `none` to the network `plugin` directive in the cluster configuration.

```yaml
network:
    plugin: none
```

# Network Plug-in Options

Besides the different images that could be used to deploy network plug-ins, certain network plug-ins support additional options that can be used to customize the network plug-in.

## Canal Network Plug-in Options

```yaml
network:
    plugin: canal
    options:
        canal_iface: eth1
        canal_flannel_backend_type: vxlan
```

#### Canal Interface

By setting the `canal_iface`, you can configure the interface to use for inter-host communication.
The `canal_flannel_backend_type` option allows you to specify the type of [flannel backend](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md) to use. By default the `vxlan` backend is used.

## Flannel Network Plug-in Options

```yaml
network:
    plugin: flannel
    options:
        flannel_iface: eth1
        flannel_backend_type: vxlan
```

#### Flannel Interface

By setting the `flannel_iface`, you can configure the interface to use for inter-host communication.
The `flannel_backend_type` option allows you to specify the type of [flannel backend](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md) to use. By default the `vxlan` backend is used.

## Calico Network Plug-in Options

```yaml
network:
    plugin: calico
    options:
        calico_cloud_provider: aws
```
#### Calico Cloud Provider

Calico currently only supports 2 cloud providers, AWS or GCE, which can be set using `calico_cloud_provider`.

**Valid Options**

- `aws`
- `gce`

## Weave Network Plug-in Options

```yaml
network:
    plugin: weave
    weave_network_provider:
        password: "Q]SZOQ5wp@n$oijz"
```

#### Weave encryption

Weave encryption can be enabled by passing a string password to the network provider config.


## Custom Network Plug-ins

It is possible to add a custom network plug-in by using the [user-defined add-on functionality]({{<baseurl>}}/rke/latest/en/config-options/add-ons/user-defined-add-ons/) of RKE. In the `addons` field, you can add the add-on manifest of a cluster that has the network plugin-that you want, as shown in [this example.]({{<baseurl>}}/rke/latest/en/config-options/add-ons/network-plugins/custom-network-plugin-example)
