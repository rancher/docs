As of v0.1.7, you can configure a RKE cluster to automatically take snapshots of etcd. In a disaster scenario, you can restore these snapshots, which are stored on other nodes in the cluster.

## One-Time Snapshots

RKE can take a one-time snapshot of a running etcd node in a RKE cluster. The snapshot is automatically saved in `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots`.

```
$ rke etcd snapshot-save --config cluster.yml     

WARN[0000] Name of the snapshot is not specified using [rke_etcd_snapshot_2018-05-17T23:32:08+02:00]
INFO[0000] Starting saving snapshot on etcd hosts

INFO[0002] [dialer] Setup tunnel for host [z.z.z.z]
INFO[0003] [etcd] Saving snapshot [rke_etcd_snapshot_2018-05-17T23:32:08+02:00] on host [x.x.x.x]

INFO[0005] [etcd] Saving snapshot [rke_etcd_snapshot_2018-05-17T23:32:08+02:00] on host [z.z.z.z]

INFO[0006] Finished saving snapshot [rke_etcd_snapshot_2018-05-17T23:32:08+02:00] on all etcd hosts
```

The command will save a snapshot of etcd from each etcd node in the cluster config file and will save it in `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots`. When running the command, an additional container is created to take the snapshot. When the snapshot is completed, the container is automatically removed.

## Etcd Recurring Snapshots

To schedule a recurring automatic etcd snapshot save, you can enable the `etcd-snapshot` service. `etcd-snapshot` runs in a service container alongside the `etcd` container. `etcd-snapshot` automatically takes a snapshot of etcd and stores them to its local disk in `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots`.


In the `cluster.yml`, you need to turn enable `snapshot` as part of the `etcd service`. Additionally, you want to specify `creation` and `retention` for the snapshot service.

```yaml
services:
    etcd:
      snapshot: true
      creation: 5m0s
      retention: 24h
```


When a cluster is launched with the etcd snapshot service enabled, you can view the `etcd-snapshot` logs to confirm backups are being created automatically.

```
$ docker logs etcd-snapshot

time="2018-05-04T18:39:16Z" level=info msg="Initializing Rolling Backups" creation=1m0s retention=24h0m0s
time="2018-05-04T18:40:16Z" level=info msg="Created backup" name="2018-05-04T18:40:16Z_etcd" runtime=108.332814ms
time="2018-05-04T18:41:16Z" level=info msg="Created backup" name="2018-05-04T18:41:16Z_etcd" runtime=92.880112ms
time="2018-05-04T18:42:16Z" level=info msg="Created backup" name="2018-05-04T18:42:16Z_etcd" runtime=83.67642ms
time="2018-05-04T18:43:16Z" level=info msg="Created backup" name="2018-05-04T18:43:16Z_etcd" runtime=86.298499ms
```

For every node that has the `etcd` role, these `backups` are saved to `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots/`.

### Snapshot Options

**Snapshot**

By default, the recurring snapshot service is disabled. To enable the service, you need to define it as part of `etcd` and set it to `true`.

**Creation**

By default, the snapshot service will take snapshots every 5 minutes (`5m0s`). You can change the time between snapshots as part of the `creation` directive for the `etcd` service.

**Retention**

By default, all snapshots are saved for 24 hours (`24h`) before being deleted and purged. You can change how long to store a snapshot as part of the `retention` directive for the `etcd` service.

## Etcd Disaster recovery

If there is a disaster with your Kubernetes cluster, you can use `rke etcd snapshot-restore` to recover your etcd. This command will revert to a specific snapshot stored in `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots` that you explicitly define. During the restore process, RKE also removes the old `etcd` container before creating a new `etcd` cluster using the snapshot that you have chosen.

>**Warning:** Restoring an etcd snapshot deletes your current etcd cluster and replaces it with a new one. Before you run the `rke etcd snapshot-restore` command, you should back up any important data in your cluster.

```
$ rke etcd snapshot-restore --name mysnapshot --config cluster.yml

## Example

In this example, the Kubernetes cluster was deployed on two AWS nodes.

|  Name |    IP    |          Role          |
|:-----:|:--------:|:----------------------:|
| node1 | 10.0.0.1 | [controlplane, worker] |
| node2 | 10.0.0.2 | [etcd]                 |

### Back up the `etcd` cluster

Take a snapshot of the Kubernetes cluster.

```
$ rke etcd snapshot-save --name snapshot.db --config cluster.yml
```

![etcd snapshot]({{< baseurl >}}/img/rke/rke-etcd-backup.png)

### Store the snapshot externally

After taking the etcd snapshot on `node2`, we recommend saving this backup in a persistence place. One of the options is to save the backup on a S3 bucket or tape backup.

```
# If you're using an AWS host and have the ability to connect to S3
root@node2:~# s3cmd mb s3://rke-etcd-backup
root@node2:~# s3cmd /opt/rke/etcdbackup/snapshot.db s3://rke-etcd-backup/
```

### Place the backup on a new node

To simulate the failure, let's power down `node2`.

```
root@node2:~# poweroff
```

Before restoring etcd and running `rancher up`, we need to retrieve the backup saved on S3 to a new node, e.g. `node3`.


|  Name |    IP    |          Role          |
|:-----:|:--------:|:----------------------:|
| node1 | 10.0.0.1 | [controlplane, worker] |
| ~~node2~~ | ~~10.0.0.2~~ | ~~[etcd]~~                 |
| node3 | 10.0.0.3 | [etcd]                 |
|   |   |   |

```
# Make a Directory
root@node3:~# mkdir -p /opt/rke/etcdbackup
$ Get the Backup from S3
root@node3:~# s3cmd get s3://rke-etcd-backup/snapshot.db /opt/rke/etcdbackup/snapshot.db
```

###  Restore `etcd` on the new node from the backup

Before updating and restoring etcd, you will need to add the new node into the Kubernetes cluster with the `etcd` role. In the `cluster.yml`, comment out the old node and add in the new node. `

```yaml
nodes:
    - address: 10.0.0.1
      hostname_override: node1
      user: ubuntu
      role:
        - controlplane
        - worker
#    - address: 10.0.0.2
#      hostname_override: node2
#      user: ubuntu
#      role:
#       - etcd
    - address: 10.0.0.3
      hostname_override: node3
      user: ubuntu
      role:
        - etcd
```

After the new node is added to the `cluster.yml`, run `rke etcd snapshot-restore` to launch `etcd` from the backup.  ]

```
$ rke etcd snapshot-restore --name snapshot.db --config cluster.yml
```

Finally, we need to restore the operations on the cluster by making the Kubernetes API point to the new `etcd`  by running `rke up` again using the new `cluster.yml`.

```
$ rke up --config cluster.yml
```

Confirm that your Kubernetes cluster is functional by checking the pods on your cluster.

```
> kubectl get pods                                                    
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-65899c769f-kcdpr   1/1       Running   0          17s
nginx-65899c769f-pc45c   1/1       Running   0          17s
nginx-65899c769f-qkhml   1/1       Running   0          17s
```

## Troubleshooting

As of **v0.1.8** and below, the **rke-bundle-cert** container is left over from a failed etcd restore. If you are having an issue with restoring an **etcd snapshot** then you can do the following on each etcd nodes before attempting to do another restore:

```
docker container rm --force rke-bundle-cert
```

The rke-bundle-cert container is usually removed when a backup or restore of **etcd** succeeds.
Whenever something goes wrong, the **rke-bundle-cert** container will be left over. You can look
at the logs or inspect the container to see what the issue is.

```
docker container logs --follow rke-bundle-cert
docker container inspect rke-bundle-cert
```

The important thing to note is the mounts of the container and location of the **pki.bundle.tar.gz**.

As of **v0.1.9**, the **rke-bundle-cert** container is removed on both success and
failure of a restore. To debug any issues, you will need to look at the **logs** generated from rke.
