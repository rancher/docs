This section contains instructions for installing K3S in testing and production environments. Please ensure you have met the [Node Requirements]({{< baseurl >}}/k3s/latest/en/installation/node-requirements/) before you begin installing K3S.

### Installation Options

*   [Single Server Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/k3s/latest/en/installation/single-server/)

	Install K3S on a single Linux host. Single server installs are recommended for development and test environments, as setup is simple and the server doesn't have to be readily available for a user-base.

*   [High Availability (HA) Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha/)

	Install K3S on two or more Linux hosts. High Availability installs are recommended for production environments.
