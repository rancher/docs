This section contains information for running k3s in various environments.

Starting the Server
------------------

The installation script will auto-detect if your OS is using systemd or openrc and start the service.
When running with openrc logs will be created at `/var/log/k3s.log`, or with systemd in `/var/log/syslog` and viewed using `journalctl -u k3s`. An example of installing and auto-starting with the install script:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

When running the server manually you should get an output similar to:

```
$ k3s server

```

The output will likely be much longer as the agent will create a lot of logs. By default the server
will register itself as a node (run the agent).

It is common and almost required these days that the control plane be part of the cluster.
To disable the agent when running the server use the `--disable-agent` flag, the agent can then be run as a separate process.

Alpine Linux
------------

In order to pre-setup Alpine Linux you have to go through the following steps:

```bash
echo "cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup cgroup defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

cat >> /etc/cgconfig.conf <<EOF
mount {
cpuacct = /cgroup/cpuacct;
memory = /cgroup/memory;
devices = /cgroup/devices;
freezer = /cgroup/freezer;
net_cls = /cgroup/net_cls;
blkio = /cgroup/blkio;
cpuset = /cgroup/cpuset;
cpu = /cgroup/cpu;
}
EOF
```

Then update **/etc/update-extlinux.conf** by adding:

```
default_kernel_opts="...  cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory"
```

Then update the config and reboot:

```bash
update-extlinux
reboot
```

After rebooting:

- download **k3s** to **/usr/local/bin/k3s**
- create an openrc file in **/etc/init.d**

Running in Docker (and docker-compose)
-----------------

[k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d) is a utility designed to easily run k3s in Docker. It can be installed via the [brew](https://brew.sh/) utility for MacOS.

`rancher/k3s` images are also available to run k3s server and agent from Docker.  A `docker-compose.yml` is in the root of the k3s repo that
serves as an example of how to run k3s from Docker.  To run from `docker-compose` from this repo run:

    docker-compose up --scale node=3
    # kubeconfig is written to current dir
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml get node

    NAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    497278a2d6a2   Ready    <none>   11s   v1.13.2-k3s2
    d54c8b17c055   Ready    <none>   11s   v1.13.2-k3s2
    db7a5a5a5bdd   Ready    <none>   12s   v1.13.2-k3s2

To run the agent only in Docker, use `docker-compose up node`. Alternatively the Docker run command can also be used;

    sudo docker run \
            -d --tmpfs /run \
            --tmpfs /var/run \
            -e K3S_URL=${SERVER_URL} \
            -e K3S_TOKEN=${NODE_TOKEN} \
            --privileged rancher/k3s:vX.Y.Z

Air-Gap Support
---------------

k3s supports pre-loading of containerd images by placing them in the `images` directory for the agent before starting, for example:
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/
sudo cp ./k3s-airgap-images-$ARCH.tar /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/
```
Images needed for a base install are provided through the releases page, additional images can be created with the `docker save` command.

Offline Helm charts are served from the `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/static` directory, and Helm chart manifests may reference the static files with a `%{KUBERNETES_API}%` templated variable. For example, the default traefik manifest chart installs from `https://%{KUBERNETES_API}%/static/charts/traefik-X.Y.Z.tgz`.

If networking is completely disabled k3s may not be able to start (ie ethernet unplugged or wifi disconnected), in which case it may be necessary to add a default route. For example:
```sh
sudo ip -c address add 192.168.123.123/24 dev eno1
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.123.1
```

k3s additionally provides a `--resolv-conf` flag for kubelets, which may help with configuring DNS in air-gap networks.

Upgrades
--------

To upgrade k3s from an older version you can re-run the installation script using the same flags, for example:

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

If you want to upgrade to specific version you can run the following command:

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Z-rc1 sh -
```

Or to manually upgrade k3s:

1. Download the desired version of k3s from [releases](https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/latest)
2. Install to an appropriate location (normally `/usr/local/bin/k3s`)
3. Stop the old version
4. Start the new version

Restarting k3s is supported by the installation script for systemd and openrc.
To restart manually for systemd use:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart k3s
```

To restart manually for openrc use:
```sh
sudo service k3s restart
```

Upgrading an air-gap environment can be accomplished in the following manner:

1. Download air-gap images and install if changed
2. Install new k3s binary (from installer or manual download)
3. Restart k3s (if not restarted automatically by installer)

Uninstalling
------------

If you installed k3s with the help of `install.sh` script an uninstall script is generated during installation, which will be created on your server node at `/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh` (or as `k3s-agent-uninstall.sh`).

Hyperkube
---------

k3s is bundled in a nice wrapper to remove the majority of the headache of running k8s. If
you don't want that wrapper and just want a smaller k8s distro, the releases includes
the `hyperkube` binary you can use.  It's then up to you to know how to use `hyperkube`. If
you want individual binaries you will need to compile them yourself from source.
