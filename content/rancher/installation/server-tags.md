# Rancher Server Tags

{{< product >}} Server has two different tags that you can use during installation.

-	`rancher/server:latest`: Our latest development builds. These builds are validated through our CI automation framework. These releases aren't for production environments.

-	`rancher/server:stable`: Our latest stable release builds. This tag is recommended for production.

Please don't use any release with a `rc{n}` suffix. These rc builds are meant for the {{< product >}} team to test out builds.
