This section is devoted to upgrading your Rancher Server, as well as other procedures related to upgrades and system maintenance.

- [Upgrade Scenarios](./upgrade-scenarios/)

    When a new version of Rancher is released, follow these instructions to upgrade to the latest version.

- [Backups](./backups/)

    To protect yourself from a disaster scenario, you should create Rancher backups on a regular basis.

- [Restorations](./restorations/)

    In a disaster scenario, you can restore your `etcd` database by restoring a backup.

- [Rollbacks](./rollbacks/)

    If an upgrade does not complete successfully, you can revert you Rancher Server to its previous version along with its data prior to upgrade.
