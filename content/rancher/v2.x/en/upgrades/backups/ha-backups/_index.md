This section describes how to create backups of your high-availability Rancher install.

## Backup Outline

Backing up your high-availability Rancher cluster is process that involves completing multiple tasks.

1.  [Meet Backup Prerequisites](#1-meet-backup-prerequisites)

	Before starting, make sure you have the files needed to create backups.

1.  [Take Snapshots of the `etcd` Database](#2-take-snapshots-of-the-etcd-database)

	Take snapshots of your current `etcd` database using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE).

1.  [Store Snapshot(s) Externally](#3-backup-snapshots-to-a-safe-location)

	After taking your snapshots, export them to a safe location that won't be affected if your cluster encounters issues.

<br/>
### 1. Meet Backup Prerequisites

Begin by gathering the files that you need to create backups of your Rancher install.

#### Prerequisites

- Rancher Kubernetes Engine v0.1.7 or later

	The commands for taking `etcd` snapshots are only available in RKE v0.1.7 and later.

- rancher-cluster.yml

	You'll need the RKE config file you used for Rancher install, `rancher-cluster.yml`. You created this file during your chosen high-availability installation scenario:
<br/>
<br/>
	- [High Availability Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha-server-install)
	- [High Availability Installation with External Load Balancer]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha-server-install-external-lb)

<br/>
### 2. Take Snapshots of the `etcd` Database

Take snapshots of your `etcd` database. You can use these snapshots later to recover from a disaster scenario. There are two ways to take snapshots: recurringly, or as a one-off.  Each option is better suited to a specific use case. Read the short description below each link to know when to use each option.

- [Option A: Recurring Snapshots](#option-a-recurring-snapshots)

	After you stand up a high-availability Rancher install, we recommend configuring RKE to automatically take recurring snapshots so that you always have a safe restoration point available.

- [Option B: One-Time Snapshots](#option-b-one-time-snapshots)

	We advise taking one-time snapshots before events like upgrades or restoration of another snapshot.

#### Option A: Recurring Snapshots

For all high-availability Rancher installs, we recommend taking recurring snapshots so that you always have a safe restoration point available.

To take recurring snapshots, enable the `etcd-snapshot` service, which is a service that's included with RKE. This service runs in a service container alongside the `etcd` container. You can enable this service by adding some code to `rancher-cluster.yml`.

**To Enable Recurring Snapshots:**

1. Open `rancher-cluster.yml` with your favorite text editor.

2. Add the following code block to the bottom of the file:

	```
	services:
	  etcd:
	    snapshot: true # enables recurring etcd snapshots
	    creation: 5m0s # time increment between snapshots
	    retention: 24h # time increment before snapshot purge
	```

3. Edit the code according to your requirements.

4. Save and close `rancher-cluster.yml`.

5. Open **Terminal** and change directory to the location of the RKE binary. Your `rancher-cluster.yml` file must reside in the same directory.

6. Run one of the following commands:

	```
	# MacOS
	./rke_darwin-amd64 up --config rancher-cluster.yml
	# Linux
	./rke_linux-amd64 up --config rancher-cluster.yml
	```


**Result:** RKE is configured to take recurring snapshots of `etcd` on all nodes running the `etcd` role. Snapshots are saved to the following directory: `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots/`.

#### Option B: One-Time Snapshots

When you're about to upgrade Rancher or restore it to a previous snapshot, you should snapshot your live image so that you have a backup of `etcd` in its last known state.

**To Take a One-Time Snapshot:**

1. Open **Terminal** and change directory to the location of the RKE binary. Your `rancher-cluster.yml` file must reside in the same directory.

2. Enter the following command. Replace `<SNAPSHOT.db>` with any name that you want to use for the snapshot (e.g. `upgrade.db`).

	```
	# MacOS
	./rke_darwin-amd64 etcd snapshot-save --name <SNAPSHOT.db> --config rancher-cluster.yml
	# Linux
	./rke_linux-amd64 etcd snapshot-save --name <SNAPSHOT.db> --config rancher-cluster.yml
	```

**Result:** RKE takes a snapshot of `etcd` running on each `etcd` node. The file is saved to `/opt/rke/etcd-snapshots`.

### 3. Backup Snapshots to a Safe Location

After taking the `etcd` snapshots, save them to a safe location so that they're unaffected if your cluster experiences a disaster scenario. This location should be persistent.

In this documentation, as an example, we're using Amazon S3 as our safe location, and [S3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) as our tool to create the backups. The backup location and tool that you use are ultimately your decision.

**Example:**

```
root@node:~# s3cmd mb s3://rke-etcd-snapshots
root@node:~# s3cmd /opt/rke/etcd-snapshots/snapshot.db s3://rke-etcd-snapshots/
```
