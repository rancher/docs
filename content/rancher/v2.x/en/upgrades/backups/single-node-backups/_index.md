After completing your single node installation of Rancher create a backup of your current installation. Use this backup as a restoration point in disaster scenarios.

>**Prerequisite:** Open Rancher and write down the version number displayed in the lower-left of the browser (example: `v2.0.0`). You'll need this number during the backup process.

1. Stop the container currently running Rancher Server. Replace `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>` with the ID of your Rancher container.

    ```
docker stop <RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

    >**Tip:** You can obtain the ID for your Rancher container by entering the following command: `docker ps`.

2. <a id="backup"></a>Create a backup container. This container backs up the data from your current Rancher Server, which you can use as a recovery point.

    - Replace `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>` with the same ID from the previous step.
    - Replace `<RANCHER_VERSION>` and `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_TAG>` with the version of Rancher that you are currently running, as mentioned in the  **Prerequisite** above.

    ```
docker create --volumes-from <RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID> \
--name rancher-backup-<RANCHER_VERSION> rancher/rancher:<RANCHER_CONTAINER_TAG>
    ```

3. Restart Rancher Server. Replace `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>` with the ID of your Rancher container.

    ```
docker start <RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

**Result:** A backup of your Rancher Server is created. If you ever need to restore your backup, see [Restoring Backups: Single Node Installs]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/restorations/single-node-restoration).
