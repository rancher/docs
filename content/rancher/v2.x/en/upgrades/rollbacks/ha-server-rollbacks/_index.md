title: Rolling Backâ€”High Availability Installs
weight: 50
---

If you upgrade Rancher, but the upgrade does not complete successfully, you may need to roll back your Rancher Server to its last healthy state before upgrade. To restore Rancher:

- Restore the `etcd` snapshot taken before upgrade.
- Run the command to revert to your prior version of Rancher.

>**Warning!** Rolling back to a previous version of Rancher destroys any changes made to Rancher following the upgrade. Unrecoverable data loss may occur.

1. Open **Terminal** and change directory to the location of the RKE binary that you used during upgrade.

1. Run one of the following commands to restore the `etcd` snapshot [that you took]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/upgrade-scenarios/ha-server-upgrade/#snapshot) before your unsuccessful upgrade. Replace the `<SNAPSHOT.db>` placeholder with your snapshot.

	```
	# MacOS
	./rke_darwin-amd64 etcd snapshot-restore --name <SNAPSHOT.db> --config rancher-cluster.yml
	# Linux
	./rke_linux-amd64 etcd snapshot-restore --name <SNAPSHOT.db> --config rancher-cluster.yml
	```

1. Run one of the following commands to bring your cluster back up:

	```
	# MacOS
	./rke_darwin-amd64 up --config rancher-cluster.yml
	# Linux
	./rke_linux-amd64 up --config rancher-cluster.yml
	```

1. Lastly, restart the Kubernetes components on all cluster nodes to prevent potential `etcd` conflicts. Run this command on each of your nodes.

    ```
    docker restart kube-apiserver kubelet kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler kube-proxy
    docker ps | grep flannel | cut -f 1 -d " " | xargs docker restart
    docker ps | grep calico | cut -f 1 -d " " | xargs docker restart
    ```
1. Enter the following command:

    ```
kubectl --kubeconfig=kube_config-rancher-cluster.yml set image deployment/cattle cattle-server=rancher/rancher:<PRIOR_VERSION> -n cattle-system
    ```
    Replace `<VERSION_TAG>` with the version that you were running before upgrade. For a list of tags available, see the [Rancher Forum Announcements](https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements).

    **Step Result:** The rollback begins. Rancher Server may be unavailable for a few minutes.

1. Log into Rancher. Confirm that the rollback succeeded by checking the version displayed in the bottom-left corner of the browser window.
