>**Notes:**
>
>- Pipelines are new and improved for Rancher v2.1! Therefore, if you configured pipelines while using v2.0.x, you'll have to reconfigure them after upgrading to v2.1.
>- Still using v2.0.x? See the pipeline documentation for [previous versions]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/docs-for-v2.0.x).

Before setting up any pipelines, review the [pipeline overview]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/project-admin/tools/pipelines/) and ensure that the project has [configured authentication to your version control provider]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/project-admin/tools/pipelines/#version-control-providers), e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitucket. If you haven't configured a version control provider, you can always use [Rancher's example repositories]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/pipelines/example/) to view some common pipeline deployments.

If you can access a project, you can enable repositories to start building pipelines. Only an [administrator]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/), [cluster owner or member]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/#cluster-roles), or [project owner]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/#project-roles) can authorize version control providers.

## Concepts

When setting up a pipeline, it's helpful to know a few related terms.

- **Pipeline:**

    A pipeline consists of stages and steps. It is based on a specific repository. It defines the process to build, test, and deploy your code. Rancher uses the [pipeline as code](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline-as-code/) model. Pipeline configuration is represented as a pipeline file in the source code repository, using the file name `.rancher-pipeline.yml` or `.rancher-pipeline.yaml`.

- **Stages:**

    A pipeline stage consists of multiple steps. Stages are executed in the order defined in the pipeline file. The steps in a stage are executed concurrently. A stage starts when all steps in the former stage finish without failure.

- **Steps:**

    A pipeline step is executed inside a specified stage. A step fails if it exits with a code other than `0`. If a step exits with this failure code, the entire pipeline fails and terminates.

- **Workspace:**

    The workspace is the working directory shared by all pipeline steps. In the beginning of a pipeline, source code is checked out to the workspace. The command for every step bootstraps in the workspace. During a pipeline execution, the artifacts from a previous step will be available in future steps. The working directory is an ephemeral volume and will be cleaned out with the executor pod when a pipeline execution is finished.

## Configuring Repositories

After the version control provider is authorized, you are automatically re-directed to start configuring which repositories that you want start using pipelines with. Even if someone else has set up the version control provider, you will see their repositories and can build a pipeline.

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to configure pipelines.

1. Select **Workloads** in the navigation bar and then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. Click on **Configure Repositories**.

1. A list of repositories are displayed. If you are configuring repositories the first time, click on **Authorize & Fetch Your Own Repositories** to fetch your repository list.

1. For each repository that you want to set up a pipeline, click on **Enable**.

1. When you're done enabling all your repositories, click on **Done**.

**Results:** You have a list of repositories that you can start configuring pipelines for.

## Pipeline Configuration

Now that repositories are added to your project, you can start configuring the pipeline by adding automated stages and steps. For your convenience, there are multiple built-in [step types](#step-types) for dedicated tasks.

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to configure pipelines.

1. Select **Workloads** in the navigation bar and then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. Find the repository that you want to set up a pipeline for. Pipelines can be configured either through the UI or using a yaml file in the repository, i.e. `.rancher-pipeline.yml` or `.rancher-pipeline.yaml`. Throughout the next couple of steps, we'll provide the options of how to do pipeline configuration through the UI or the YAML file.

   * If you are going to use the UI, select the vertical **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config** to configure the pipeline using the UI. After the pipeline is configured, you must view the YAML file and push it to the repository.
   * If you are going to use the YAML file, select the vertical **Ellipsis (...) **View/Edit YAML** to configure the pipeline. If you choose to use a YAML file, you need to push it to the repository after any changes in order for it to be updated in the repository.

    >**Note:** When editing the pipeline configuration, it takes a few moments for Rancher to check for an existing pipeline configuration.

1. Select which `branch` to use from the list of branches.

1. Pipeline configuration is split into stages and [steps](#step-types). Remember that stages must fully complete before moving onto the next stage, but steps in a stage run concurrently.

    For each stage, you can add different step types. Learn more about how to configure each step type:

    - [Run Script](#run-script)
    - [Build and Publish Images](#build-and-publish-images)
    - [Publish Catalog Template](#publish-catalog-template)
    - [Deploy YAML](#deploy-yaml)
    - [Deploy Catalog App](#deploy-catalog-app)

    >**Note:** As you build out each step, there are different [advanced options](#advanced-options) based on the step type.

    {{% accordion id="stages-and-steps" label="Adding Stages and Steps" %}}
{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By UI" %}}
<br>
If you haven't added any stages, click **Configure pipeline for this branch** to configure the pipeline through the UI.

1. Add stages to your pipeline execution by clicking **Add Stage**.

   1. Enter a **Name** for each stage of your pipeline.
   1. For each stage, you can configure [trigger rules](#trigger-rules) by clicking on **Show Advanced Options**. Note: this can always be updated at a later time.

1. After you've created a stage, start [adding steps](#step-types) by clicking **Add a Step**. You can add multiple steps to each stage.

<br>
For each stage, you can add multiple steps. Read more about each [step type](#step-types) and the [advanced options](#advanced-options) to get all thhe details on how to configure the YAML. This is only a small example of how to have multiple stages with a singular step in each stage.

```yaml
# example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    # Conditions for stages
    when:
      branch: master
      event: [ push, pull_request ]
    # Multiple steps run concurrently
    steps:
      - runScriptConfig:
          image: busybox
          shellScript: date -R
  - name: Publish my image
    steps:
    - publishImageConfig:
        dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
        buildContext: .
        tag: rancher/rancher:v2.0.0
        # Optionally push to remote registry
        pushRemote: true
        registry: reg.example.com
```

1. _Available as of v2.2.0_

    **Notifications:** Decide if you want to set up notifications for your pipeline. You can enable notifications to any [notifiers]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/tools/notifiers/) based on the build status of a pipeline. Before enabling notifications, Rancher recommends [setting up notifiers]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/tools/notifiers/#adding-notifiers) so it will be easy to add recipients immediately.

    {{% accordion id="notification" label="Configuring Notifications" %}}


{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By UI" %}}
<br>
_Available as of v2.2.0_

1. Within the **Notification** section, turn on notifications by clicking **Enable**.

1. Select the conditions for the notification. You can select to get a notification for the following statuses: `Failed`, `Success`, `Changed`. For example, if you want to receive notifications when an execution fails, select **Failed**.

1. If you don't have any existing [notifiers]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/tools/notifiers), Rancher will provide a warning that no notifers are set up and provide a link to be able to go to the notifiers page. Follow the [instructions]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/tools/notifiers/#adding-notifiers) to add a notifier. If you  already have notifiers, you can add them to the notification by clicking the **Add Recipient** button.

    > **Note:** Notifiers are configured at a cluster level and require a different level of permissions.

1. For each recipient, select which notifier type from the dropdown. Based on the type of notifier, you can use the default recipient or override the recipient with a different one. For example, if you have a notifier for _Slack_, you can update which channel to send the notification to. You can add additional notifiers by clicking **Add Recipient**.
<br>
<br>
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "By YAML" %}}
<br>
_Available as of v2.2.0_

In the `notification` section, you will provide the following information:

* **Recipients:** This will be the list of notifiers/recipients that will receive the notification.
  * **Notifier:** The ID of the notifier. This can be found by finding the notifier and selecting **View in API** to get the ID.
  * **Recipient:** Depending on the type of the notifier, the "default recipient" can be used or you can override this with a different recipient. For example, when configuring a slack notifier, you select a channel as your default recipient, but if you wanted to send notifications to a different channel, you can select a different recipient.
* **Condition:** Select which conditions of when you want the notification to be sent.
* **Message (Optional):** If you want to change the default notification message, you can edit this in the yaml. Note: This option is not available in the UI.  

```yaml
# Example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: ls
notification:
  recipients:
  - # Recipient
    recipient: "#mychannel"
    # ID of Notifier
    notifier: "c-wdcsr:n-c9pg7"
  - recipient: "test@example.com"
    notifier: "c-wdcsr:n-lkrhd"
  # Select which statuses you want the notification to be sent  
  condition: ["Failed", "Success", "Changed"]
  # Ability to override the default message (Optional)

1. When all the stages and steps are configured, click **Done**.

**Results:** Your pipeline is now configured and ready to be run.

## Running your Pipelines

Run your pipeline for the first time. From the **Pipeline** tab, find your pipeline and select the vertical **Ellipsis (...) > Run**.

During this initial run, your pipeline is tested, and the following [pipeline components]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/project-admin/tools/pipelines/#how-pipelines-work) are deployed to your project as workloads in a new namespace dedicated to the pipeline:

- `docker-registry`
- `jenkins`
- `minio`

This process takes several minutes. When it completes, you can view each pipeline component from the project **Workloads** tab.

## Pipeline Setting

When a repository is enabled, a webhook is automatically set in the version control provider. By default, the pipeline is triggered by a **push** event to a repository, but you can modify the event(s) that trigger running the pipeline.

Available Events:

* **Push**: Whenever a commit is pushed to the branch in the repository, the pipeline is triggered.
* **Pull Request**: Whenever a pull request is made to the repository, the pipeline is triggered.
* **Tag**: When a tag is created in the repository, the pipeline is triggered.

> **Note:** This option doesn't exist for Rancher's [example repositories]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/pipelines/example/).

### Modifying the Event Triggers for the Repository

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to modify the event trigger for the pipeline.

1. Select **Workloads** in the navigation bar and then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. Find the repository that you want to modify the event triggers. Select the vertical **Ellipsis (...) > Setting**.

1. Select which event triggers (**Push**, **Pull Request** or **Tag**) you want for the repository.

1. Click **Save**.

## Step Types

Within each stage, you can add as many steps as you'd like. When there are multiple steps in one stage, they run concurrently.

- [Run Script](#run-script)
- [Build and Publish Images](#build-and-publish-images)
- [Publish Catalog Template](#publish-catalog-template)
- [Deploy YAML](#deploy-yaml)
- [Deploy Catalog App](#deploy-catalog-app)

<!--
### Clone

The first stage is preserved to be a cloning step that checks out source code from your repo. Rancher handles the cloning of the git repository. This action is equivalent to `git clone <repository_link> <workspace_dir>`.
-->

### Run Script

The **Run Script** step executes arbitrary commands in the workspace inside a specified container. You can use it to build, test and do more, given whatever utilities the base image provides. For your convenience, you can use variables to refer to metadata of a pipeline execution. Please refer to the [pipeline variable substitution reference](#pipeline-variable-substitution-reference) for the list of available variables.

1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Build and Publish**.

1. Fill in the rest of the form. Descriptions for each field are listed below. When you're done, click **Add**.

    Field | Description |
    ---------|----------|
     Dockerfile Path | The relative path to the Dockerfile in the source code repo. By default, this path is `./Dockerfile`, which assumes the Dockerfile is in the root directory. You can set it to other paths in different use cases (`./path/to/myDockerfile` for example). |
     Image Name | The image name in `name:tag` format. The registry address is not required. For example, to build  `example.com/repo/my-image:dev`, enter `repo/my-image:dev`. |
     Push image to remote repository | An option to set the registry that publishes the image that's built.  To use this option, enable it and choose a registry from the drop-down. If this option is disabled, the image is pushed to the internal registry. |
     Build Context <br/><br/> (**Show advanced options**)| By default, the root directory of the source code (`.`). For more details, see the Docker [build command documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).

### Publish Catalog Template

_Available as of v2.2.0_

The **Publish Catalog Template** step publishes a version of a catalog app template (i.e. Helm chart) to a [git hosted chart repository]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/catalog/custom/). It generates a git commit and pushes it to your chart repository. This process requires a chart folder in your source code's repository and a pre-configured secret in the dedicated pipeline namespace to complete successfully. Any variables in the [pipeline variable substitution reference](#pipeline-variable-substitution-reference) is supported for any file in the chart folder.

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "By UI" %}}
<br/>

1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Publish Catalog Template**.

1. Fill in the rest of the form. Descriptions for each field are listed below. When you're done, click **Add**.

    Field | Description |
    ---------|----------|
     Chart Folder | The relative path to the chart folder in the source code repo, where the `Chart.yaml` file is located. |
     Catalog Template Name | The name of the template. For example, wordpress. |
     Catalog Template Version | The version of the template you want to publish, it should be consistent with the version defined in the `Chart.yaml` file. |
     Protocol | You can choose to publish via HTTP(S) or SSH protocol. |
     Secret   | The secret that stores your Git credentials. You need to create a secret in dedicated pipeline namespace in the project before adding this step. If you use HTTP(S) protocol, store Git username and password in `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` key of the secret. If you use SSH protocol, store Git deploy key in `DEPLOY_KEY` key of the secret. After the secret is created, select it in this option. |
     Git URL  | The Git URL of the chart repository that the template will be published to. |
     Git Branch | The Git branch of the chart repository that the template will be published to. |
     Author Name | The author name used in the commit message. |
     Author Email | The author email used in the commit message. |


{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "By YAML" %}}
<br>
You can add **Publish Catalog Template** steps directly in the `.rancher-pipeline.yml` file.

Under the `steps` section, add a step with `publishCatalogConfig`. You will provide the following information:

* Path: The relative path to the chart folder in the source code repo, where the `Chart.yaml` file is located.
* CatalogTemplate: The name of the template.
* Version: The version of the template you want to publish, it should be consistent with the version defined in the `Chart.yaml` file.
* GitUrl: The git URL of the chart repository that the template will be published to.
* GitBranch: The git branch of the chart repository that the template will be published to.
* GitAuthor: The author name used in the commit message.
* GitEmail: The author email used in the commit message.
* Credentials: You should provide Git credentials by referencing secrets in dedicated pipeline namespace. If you publish via SSH protocol, inject your deploy key to the `DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable. If you publish via HTTP(S) protolcol, inject your username and password to `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` environment variables.

```yaml
# example
stages:
- name: Publish Wordpress Template
  steps:
  - publishCatalogConfig:
      path: ./charts/wordpress/latest
      catalogTemplate: wordpress
      version: ${CICD_GIT_TAG}
      gitUrl: git@github.com:myrepo/charts.git
      gitBranch: master

### Deploy YAML

This step deploys arbitrary Kubernetes resources to the project. This deployment requires a Kubernetes manifest file to be present in the source code repository. Pipeline variable substitution is supported in the manifest file. You can view an example file at [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/pipeline-example-go/blob/master/deployment.yaml). Please refer to the [pipeline variable substitution reference](#pipeline-variable-substitution-reference) for the list of available variables.

You can add **Deploy Catalog App** steps directly in the `.rancher-pipeline.yml` file.

Under the `steps` section, add a step with `applyAppConfig`. You will provide the following information:

* CatalogTemplate: The ID of the template. This can be found by clicking `Launch app` and selecting `View details` for the app. It is the last part of the URL.
* Version: The version of the template you want to deploy.
* Answers: Key-value pairs of answers used to deploy the app.
* Name: The name of the app you want to deploy.
* TargetNamespace: The target namespace where you want to deploy the app.

```yaml
# example
stages:
- name: Deploy App
  steps:
  - applyAppConfig:

## Advanced Options

Within a pipeline, there are multiple advanced options for different parts of the pipeline.

- [Trigger Rules](#trigger-rules)
- [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
- [Secrets](#secrets)

### Trigger Rules

Trigger rules can be created to have fine-grained control of pipeline executions in your pipeline configuration. Trigger rules come in two types:

- **Run this when:**

    This type of rule starts the pipeline, stage, or step when a trigger explicitly occurs.

- **Do Not Run this when:**

    This type of rule skips the pipeline, stage, or step when a trigger explicitly occurs.

If all conditions evaluate to `true`, then the pipeline/stage/step is executed. Otherwise it is skipped. When a pipeline is skipped, none of the pipeline is executed. When a stage/step is skipped, it is considered successful and follow-up stages/steps continue to run.

Wildcard character (`*`) expansion is supported in `branch` conditions.

### Environment Variables

When configuring a pipeline, certain [step types](#step-types) allow you to use environment variables to configure the step's script.

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By UI" %}}
1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to configure pipelines.

1. Select **Workloads** in the navigation bar and then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. From the pipeline for which you want to edit build triggers, select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config**.

1. Within one of the stages, find the **step** that you want to add an environment variable for, click the **Edit** icon.

1. Click **Show advanced options**.  

1. Click **Add Variable**, and then enter a key and value in the fields that appear. Add more variables if needed.

1. Add your environment variable(s) into either the script or file.

1. Click **Save**.

  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: echo ${FIRST_KEY} && echo ${SECOND_KEY}
      env:
        FIRST_KEY: VALUE
        SECOND_KEY: VALUE2
```

### Secrets

If you need to use security-sensitive information in your pipeline scripts (like a password), you can pass them in using Kubernetes [secrets]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/secrets/).

#### Prerequisite
Create a secret in the same project as your pipeline, or explicitly in the namespace where pipeline build pods run.
<br>

>**Note:** Secret injection is disabled on [pull request events](#pipeline-setting).

## Pipeline Variable Substitution Reference

For your convenience, the following variables are available for your pipeline configuration scripts. During pipeline executions, these variables are replaced by metadata. You can reference them in the form of `${VAR_NAME}`.

Variable Name           | Description
------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
`CICD_GIT_REPO_NAME`      | Repository name (Github organization omitted).
`CICD_GIT_URL`            | URL of the Git repository.
`CICD_GIT_COMMIT`         | Git commit ID being executed.
`CICD_GIT_BRANCH`         | Git branch of this event.
`CICD_GIT_REF`            | Git reference specification of this event.
`CICD_GIT_TAG`            | Git tag name, set on tag event.
`CICD_EVENT`              | Event that triggered the build (`push`, `pull_request` or `tag`).
`CICD_PIPELINE_ID`        | Rancher ID for the pipeline.
`CICD_EXECUTION_SEQUENCE` | Build number of the pipeline.
`CICD_EXECUTION_ID`       | Combination of `{CICD_PIPELINE_ID}-{CICD_EXECUTION_SEQUENCE}`.
`CICD_REGISTRY`           | Address for the Docker registry for the previous publish image step, available in the Kubernetes manifest file of a `Deploy YAML` step.
`CICD_IMAGE`              | Name of the image built from the previous publish image step, available in the Kubernetes manifest file of a `Deploy YAML` step. It does not contain the image tag.<br/><br/> [Example](https://github.com/rancher/pipeline-example-go/blob/master/deployment.yaml)
