Using the Kubernetes [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) feature (HPA), you can configure your cluster to automatically scale the services it's running up or down.

Clusters created in Rancher v2.0.7 and higher have all the requirements needed (metrics-server and Kubernetes cluster configuration) to use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

You can create, manage, and delete HPAs using the Rancher UI in Rancher v2.3.0-alpha4 and higher versions. It only supports HPA in the `autoscaling/v2beta2` API.

## Why Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler?

Using HPA, you can automatically scale the number of pods within a replication controller, deployment, or replica set up or down. HPA automatically scales the number of pods that are running for maximum efficiency. Factors that affect the number of pods include:

- A minimum and maximum number of pods allowed to run, as defined by the user.
- Observed CPU/memory use, as reported in resource metrics.
- Custom metrics provided by third-party metrics application like Prometheus, Datadog, etc.

HPA improves your services by:

- Releasing hardware resources that would otherwise be wasted by an excessive number of pods.
- Increase/decrease performance as needed to accomplish service level agreements.

## How HPA Works

![HPA Schema]({{< baseurl >}}/img/rancher/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.jpg)

HPA is implemented as a control loop, with a period controlled by the `kube-controller-manager` flags below:

Flag | Default | Description |
---------|----------|----------|
 `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period` | `30s` | How often HPA audits resource/custom metrics in a deployment.
 `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-delay` | `5m0s` | Following completion of a downscale operation, how long HPA must wait before launching another downscale operations.
 `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-upscale-delay` | `3m0s` | Following completion of an upscale operation, how long HPA must wait before launching another upscale operation.


For full documentation on HPA, refer to the [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler API Objects

HPA is an API resource in the Kubernetes `autoscaling` API group. The current stable version is `autoscaling/v1`, which only includes support for CPU autoscaling. To get additional support for scaling based on memory and custom metrics, use the beta version instead: `autoscaling/v2beta1`.

For more information about the HPA API object, see the [HPA GitHub Readme](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/autoscaling/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md#horizontalpodautoscaler-object).

## Managing HPAs

In Rancher v2.3.x+, the Rancher UI supports [creating, managing, and deleting HPAs]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/horitzontal-pod-autoscaler/manage-hpa-with-rancher-ui/). It lets you configure CPU or memory usage as the metric that the HPA uses to scale.

For prior versions of Rancher, you can [manage HPAs using `kubectl`]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/horitzontal-pod-autoscaler/manage-hpa-with-kubectl/_index.md). You also need to use `kubectl` if you want to create HPAs that scale based on other metrics than CPU and memory.

## Testing HPAs with a Service Deployment

In Rancher v2.3.x+, you can see your HPA's current number of replicas by going to your project's **HPA** tab. For more information, refer to [Get HPA Metrics and Status]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/horitzontal-pod-autoscaler/manage-hpa-with-rancher-ui/).

You can also use `kubectl` to get the status of HPAs that you test with your load testing tool. For more information, refer to [Testing HPAs with kubectl]
({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/horitzontal-pod-autoscaler/testing-hpa/).
