## Projects

_Projects_ are objects that captures a set of policies for a set of namespaces. They are a new concept introduced by Rancher, and they are not a native Kubernetes construct.

You can use projects to perform actions like:

- Assigning users to access to a group of namespaces (i.e., [project membership]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/projects-and-namespaces/project-members))
- Assigning users specific roles in a project. A role can be owner, member, read-only, or [custom]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/default-custom-roles/). Policies include Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies.
- Assigning Pod Security Policies.

<!-- 
When you create a cluster, two project are automatically created within it:

- [Default Project](#default-project)
- [System Project](#system-project) -->

### Default Project

When you provision a cluster, it automatically creates a `default` project for the cluster. This is a project you can use to get started with your cluster, but you can always delete it and replace it with projects that have more descriptive names.

<!-- ### System Project

_available as of v2.0.7_

When troubleshooting, you can view the `system` project to check if important namespaces in the Kubernetes system are working properly. This easily accessible project saves you from troubleshooting individual system namespace containers.

To open it, open the **Global** menu, and then select the `system` project for your cluster. 

The `system` project:

- Is automatically created when you provision a cluster.
- Lists all namespaces that exist in `v3/settings/system-namespaces`, if they exist.
- Allows you to add more namespaces or move its namespaces to other projects.
- Cannot be deleted because it's required for cluster operations.

>**Note:** In clusters where both:
>
> - The [Canal network plug-in]({{< baseurl >}}\rancher\v2.x\en\cluster-provisioning\rke-clusters\options\#canal) is in use.
> - The Project Network Isolation option is enabled.
>
>The `system` project overrides the Project Network Isolation option so that it can communicate with other projects, collect logs, and check health. -->

## Authorization

Non-administrative users are only authorized for project access after an administrator explicitly adds them to the project's **Members** tab.

>**Exception:**
> Non-administrative users can access projects that they create themselves.

## Pod Security Policies

Rancher extends Kubernetes to allow the application of [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) at the project level in addition to the cluster level. However, as a best practice, we recommend applying Pod Security Policies at the cluster level.

## Namespaces

Kubernetes resources belong to specific namespaces. Rancher 2.0 relies on namespaces to isolate resources among users and apps. When the user deploys an app from the catalog, for example, he can choose to deploy that app into its own namespace, so that resource names in one app will not conflict with resource names in another. Namespaces must be globally unique. It is often difficult for users to pick unique namespace names. Rancher therefore encourages the pattern where users work with projects, and the system generates unique namespace names automatically.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes Namespaces Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

## Creating Projects

1. From the **Global** view, choose **Clusters** from the main menu. From the **Clusters** page, open the cluster from which you want to create a project.

1. From the main menu, choose **Projects/Namespaces**. Then click **Add Project**.

1. Enter a **Project Name**.

1. **Optional:** Select a **Pod Security Policy**. Assigning a PSP to a project will:

  - Override the cluster's default PSP.
  - Apply the PSP to the project.
  - Apply the PSP to any namespaces you add to the project later.

    >**Note:** This option is only available if you've already created a Pod Security Policy. For instruction, see [Creating Pod Security Policies]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/pod-security-policies/).

1. **Recommended:** Add project members.

    Use the **Members** accordion to provide other users with project access and roles.

    By default, your user is added as the project `Owner`.

    1. Click **Add Member**.

    1. From the **Name** combo box, search for a user or group that you want to assign project access.

        >**Note:** You can only search for groups if external authentication is enabled.

    1. From the **Role** drop-down, choose a role.

        [What are Roles?]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/)

        >**Tip:** Choose Custom to create a custom role on the fly: [Custom Project Roles]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/#custom-project-roles).

    1. To add more members, repeat substeps aâ€”c.


1. Click **Create**.

**Result:** Your project is created. You can view it from the cluster's **Projects/Namespaces** view.

## Switching Projects

To switch between clusters, use the **Global** drop-down available in the main menu.

![Global Menu]({{< baseurl >}}/img/rancher/global-menu.png)

Alternatively, you can switch between projects and clusters using the main menu.

- To switch between clusters, open the **Global** view and select **Clusters** from the main menu. Then open a cluster.
- To switch between projects, open a cluster, and then select **Projects/Namespaces** from the main menu. Select the link for the project that you want to open.
