After projects are created, there are certain aspects that can be changed later.

## Adding Members

Following project creation, you can add users as project members so that they can access its resources.

>**Ping, Keycloak, and MS FS Caveats:**
>
>- IdP does not support search or lookup. When adding users to projects, the exact IDs must be entered correctly.
>- When adding users to a project, group IDs are not supported unless the admin who turned on access control is a member of the group.
>- When adding a group that includes an admin to projects, add it from the drop-down rather than the search bar. If you add the group using the search bar, the group will not get added.

1. From the **Global** view, open the project that you want to add members to.

2. From the main menu, select **Members**. Then click **Add Member**.

3. Search for the user or group that you want to add to the project.

 	If external authentication is configured:

	-  Rancher returns users from your external authentication source as you type.  

	- A drop-down allows you to add groups instead of individual users. The dropdown only lists groups that you, the logged in user, are included in.

	>**Note:** If you are logged in as a local user, external users do not display in your search results.

1. Assign the user or group **Project** roles.  

	[What are Project Roles?]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/)

	>**Tip:** For Custom Roles, you can modify the list of individual roles available for assignment.
	>
	> - To add roles to the list, [Add a Custom Role]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/default-custom-roles).
	> - To remove roles from the list, [Lock/Unlock Roles]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/locked-roles/).

**Result:** The chosen users are added to the project.

- To revoke project membership, select the user and click **Delete**. This action deletes membership, not the user.
- To modify a user's roles in the project, delete them from the project, and then re-add them with modified roles.

## Editing the Pod Security Policy

>**Note:** These cluster options are only available for [clusters that Rancher has launched Kubernetes]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/).  

You can always assign a PSP to an existing project if you didn't assign one during creation.

>**Prerequisites:**
>
> - Create a Pod Security Policy within Rancher. Before you can assign a default PSP to an existing project, you must have a PSP available for assignment. For instruction, see [Creating Pod Security Policies]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/pod-security-policies/).
> - Assign a default Pod Security Policy to the project's cluster. You can't assign a PSP to a project until one is already applied to the cluster. For more information, see [Existing Cluster: Adding a Pod Security Policy]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/editing-clusters/#adding-changing-a-pod-security-policy).

1. From the **Global** view, find the cluster containing the project you want to apply a PSP to.

1. From the main menu, select **Projects/Namespaces**.

3. Find the project that you want to add a PSP to. From that project, select **Vertical Ellipsis (...) > Edit**.

4. From the **Pod Security Policy** drop-down, select the PSP you want to apply to the project.
  Assigning a PSP to a project will:

  - Override the cluster's default PSP.
  - Apply the PSP to the project.
  - Apply the PSP to any namespaces you add to the project later.

5. Click **Save**.

**Result:** The PSP is applied to the project and any namespaces added to the project.

>**Note:** Any workloads that are already running in a cluster or project before a PSP is assigned will not be checked if it complies with the PSP. Workloads would need to be cloned or upgraded to see if they pass the PSP.

## Editing Resource Quotas

_Available as of v2.0.1_

Edit [resource quotas]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/projects-and-namespaces/resource-quotas) when:

- You want to limit the resources that a project and its namespaces can use.
- You want to scale the resources available to a project up or down when a research quota is already in effect.

1. From the **Global** view, open the cluster containing the project to which you want to apply a resource quota.

1. From the main menu, select **Projects/Namespaces**.

1. Find the project that you want to add a resource quota to. From that project, select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit**.
    
1. Expand **Resource Quotas** and click **Add Quota**. Alternatively, you can edit existing quotas.
    
1. Select a [Resource Type]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/projects-and-namespaces/resource-quotas/#resource-quota-types).
     
1. Enter values for the **Project Limit** and the **Namespace Default Limit**.
        
    | Field                   | Description                                                                                              |
    | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Project Limit           | The overall resource limit for the project.                                                              |
    | Namespace Default Limit | The default resource limit available for each namespace. This limit is propagated to each namespace in the project. The combined limit of all project namespaces shouldn't exceed the project limit. | 
    
1. **Optional:** Add more quotas.

1. Click **Create**.
 
**Result:** The resource quota is applied to your project and namespaces. When you add more namespaces in the future, Rancher validates that the project can accommodate the namespace. If the project can't allocate the resources, Rancher won't let you save your changes.
