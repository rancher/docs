Out-of-the-box, Rancher provides support for creating clusters using many popular cloud providers: Amazon EC2, Azure, DigitalOcean, and so on. However, you may want to create a cluster using another cloud provider. In these scenarios, you can create a custom node driver for the cloud provider and point Rancher toward it.

For more information on creating node drivers, see [https://github.com/rancher/ui-driver-skel](https://github.com/rancher/ui-driver-skel).
