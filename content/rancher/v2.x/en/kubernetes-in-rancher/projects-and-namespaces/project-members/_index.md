If you want to provide a user with access and permissions to _specific_ projects and resources within a cluster, assign the user a project membership.

>**Tip:** Want to provide a user with access to _all_ projects within a cluster? See [Adding Cluster Members]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/cluster-members/) instead.

There are two contexts where you can add project members:

- [Adding Members when Creating New Projects]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/projects-and-namespaces/)

    You can add members to a project as you create it (recommended if possible).

- [Adding Members to an Existing Project]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/projects-and-namespaces/editing-projects/)

	You can always add members to a project later.
