Deploy a workload to run an application in one or more containers.

1. From the **Global** view, open the project that you want to deploy a workload to.

1. From the **Workloads** view, click **Deploy**.

1. Enter a **Name** for the workload.

1. Select a [workload type]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/workloads/). The workload defaults to a scalable deployment, by can change the workload type by clicking **More options.**

1. From the **Docker Image** field, enter the name of the Docker image that you want to deploy to the project. During deployment, Rancher pulls this image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/). Enter the name exactly as it appears on Docker Hub.

1. Either select an existing [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/), or click **Add to a new namespace** and enter a new namespace.

1. Click **Add Port** to enter a port mapping, which enables access to the application inside and outside of the cluster . For more information, see [Services]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/workloads/#services).

1. Configure the remaining options:

    - **Environment Variables**

        Use this section to either specify environment variables for your workload to consume on the fly, or to pull them from another source, such as a secret or [ConfigMap]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/configmaps/).

    - **Node Scheduling**
    - **Health Check**
    - **Volumes**

        Use this section to add storage for your workload. You can manually specify the volume that you want to add, use a persistent volume claim to dynamically create a volume for the workload, or read data for a volume to use from a file such as a [ConfigMap]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/configmaps/).

    - **Scaling/Upgrade Policy**

        >**Amazon Note for Volumes:**
        >
        > To mount an Amazon EBS volume:
        >
        >- In [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), the nodes must be in the same Availability Zone and possess IAM permissions to attach/unattach volumes.
        >
        >- The cluster must be using the [AWS cloud provider](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#aws) option. For more information on enabling this option see [Creating an Amazon EC2 Cluster]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/node-pools/ec2/) or [Creating a Custom Cluster]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/custom-clusters/).


1. Click **Show Advanced Options** and configure:

    - **Command**
    - **Networking**
    - **Labels & Annotations**
    - **Security and Host Config**

1. Click **Launch**.

**Result:** The workload is deployed to the chosen namespace. You can view the workload's status from the project's **Workloads** view.
