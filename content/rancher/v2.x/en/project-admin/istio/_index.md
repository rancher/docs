_Available as of v2.3.0-alpha4_

Using Rancher, you can connect, secure, control, and observe services through integration with [Istio](https://istio.io/), a leading open-source service mesh solution. Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole, offering a complete solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications.

>**Prerequisites:**
>
>- [Istio]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/tools/istio/) must be enabled in the cluster.
>- To be a part of an Istio service mesh, pods and services in a Kubernetes cluster must satisfy the [Istio Pods and Services Requirements](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/prepare/requirements/).

## Istio Sidecar Auto Injection

In the create and edit namespace page, you can enable or disable [Istio sidecar auto injection](https://istio.io/blog/2019/data-plane-setup/#automatic-injection). When you enable it, Rancher will add `istio-injection=enabled` label to the namespace automatically.

After the `istio-injection=enabled` label is added to the namespace, all pods that are created in the namespace will have an injected Istio sidecar.

> **Note:** Injection occurs at pod creation time. If the pod has been created before you enable auto injection. You need to kill the running pod and verify a new pod is created with the injected sidecar.

## View Traffic Graph

Rancher integrates a Kiali graph into the Rancher UI. The Kiali graph provides a powerful way to visualize the topology of your Istio service mesh. It shows you which services communicate with each other.

To see the traffic graph for a particular namespace:

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to view traffic graph for.

1. Select **Istio** in the navigation bar.

1. Select **Traffic Graph** in the navigation bar.

1. Select the namespace. Note: It only shows the namespaces which have the `istio-injection=enabled` label.

## View Traffic Metrics

Istioâ€™s monitoring features provide visibility into the performance of all your services. To see the Success Rate, Request Volume, 4xx Response Count, Project 5xx Response Count and Request Duration metrics:

1. From the **Global** view, navigate to the project that you want to view traffic metrics for.

1. Select **Istio** in the navigation bar.

1. Select **Traffic Metrics** in the navigation bar.

There are many other [Istio Features](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/#core-features)
that you can now use in your cluster.
