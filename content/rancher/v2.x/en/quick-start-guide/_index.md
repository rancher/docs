>**Note:** The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see [Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/).

Howdy buckaroos! Use this section of the docs to jump start your deployment and testing of Rancher 2.x! It contains instructions for a simple Rancher setup and some common use cases. We plan on adding more content to this section in the future.

We have Quick Start Guides for:

- [Deploying Rancher Server]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/): Get started running Rancher using the method most convenient for you.

- [Deploying Workloads]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/workload/): Deploy a simple workload and expose it, letting you access it from outside the cluster.

- [Using the CLI]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/cli/): Use `kubectl` or Rancher command line interface (CLI) to interact with your Rancher instance.
