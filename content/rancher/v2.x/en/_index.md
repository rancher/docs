## What's New?

The previous version of Rancher, version 1.6, was a container management platform built on Docker. Rancher 2.x builds on the success and experience of Rancher 1.6.

However, for version 2.x, most of Rancher is redesigned to work on Kubernetes. Rancher 2.x retains the user-friendly features of version 1.6, such as the UI and catalog. However, 2.x now includes many new features such as:

- Built-in CI pipeline
- Alerts and log aggregation
- Multi-cluster management
- Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)
- Integration with cloud Kubernetes services, such as GKE, EKS, and AKS.
