## What's a Cluster?

A cluster is a group of computing resources that work as a team to accomplish a goal. Each individual computer in a cluster is called a _node_.

## Cluster Creation

Rancher simplifies creation of Kubernetes clusters by allowing you to create them with the Rancher UI rather than a config file.

### Node Components

A Kubernetes cluster contains 3 types of nodes: etcd nodes, control plane nodes, and worker nodes.

#### etcd Nodes

The etcd nodes are used to run the etcd database. etcd is a key value store used as Kubernetesâ€™ backing store for all cluster data. Even though you can run etcd on a single node, you need 3, 5, or 7 nodes for redundancy.

#### Control Plane Nodes

The control plane nodes are used to run the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, and controller manager. Control plane nodes are stateless since all cluster data are stored on etcd nodes. You can run control plane on 1 node, although 2 or more nodes are required for redundancy. You can also run control plane on etcd nodes.

#### Worker Nodes

Worker nodes are used to run the kubelet and the workload. It also runs the storage and networking drivers and ingress controllers when required. You create as many worker nodes as needed for your workload needs.
