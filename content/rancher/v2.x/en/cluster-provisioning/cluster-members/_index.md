If you want to provide a user with access and permissions to _all_ projects, nodes, and resources within a cluster, assign the user a cluster membership.

>**Tip:** Want to provide a user with access to a _specific_ project within a cluster? See [Adding Project Members]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/projects-and-namespaces/project-members/) instead.

There are two contexts where you can add cluster members:

- Adding Members to a New Cluster

    You can add members to a cluster as you create it (recommended if possible).

- [Adding Members to an Existing Cluster](/rancher/v2.x/en/kubernetes-in-rancher/editing-clusters/)

    You can always add members to a cluster after a cluster is provisioned.
