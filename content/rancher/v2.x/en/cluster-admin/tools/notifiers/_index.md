Notifiers are services that inform you of alert events. You can configure notifiers to send alert notifications to staff best suited to take corrective action.

Notifiers are configured at the cluster level. This model ensures that only cluster owners need to configure notifiers, leaving project owners to simply configure alerts in the scope of their projects. You don't need to dispense privileges like SMTP server access or cloud account access.

Rancher integrates with a variety of popular IT services, including:

- **Slack**: Send alert notifications to your Slack channels.
- **Email**: Choose email recipients for alert notifications.
- **PagerDuty**: Route notifications to staff by phone, SMS, or personal email.
- **WebHooks**: Update a webpage with alert notifications.
- **WeChat**: Send alert notifications to your Enterprise WeChat contacts.
