Configuring a pipeline automates the process of triggering and publishing builds. This section describes how to set up a pipeline in a production environment. 

- The [Basic Configuration](#basic-configuration) section provides sequential instruction on how to configure a functional pipeline.
- The [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) section provides instructions for configuring pipeline options.

## Basic Configuration

To configure a functional pipeline for your project, begin by completing the mandatory basic configuration steps.

### Pipeline Configuration Outline

Initial configuration of a pipeline in a production environment involves completion of several mandatory procedures.

>**Note:** Before setting up a pipeline for a production environment, we recommend trying the [Pipeline Quick Start Guide]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/quick-start-guide).

### 1. Configuring Version Control Providers

Begin configuration of your pipeline by enabling authentication with your version control provider. Rancher Pipeline supports integration with GitHub and GitLab. 

Select your provider's tab below and follow the directions.

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "GitHub" %}}
1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline. 

1. From the main menu, select **Resources > Pipelines**.

1. Follow the directions displayed to setup an OAuth application in GitHub.

    ![GitHub Pipeline Instructions]({{< baseurl >}}/img/rancher/github-pipeline.png)

1. From GitHub, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste them into Rancher.

1. If you're using GitHub for enterprise, select **Use a private github enterprise installation**. Enter the host address of your GitHub installation.

1. Click **Authenticate**. 

1. Enable the repository for which you want to run a pipeline. Then click **Done**.  

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "GitLab" %}}
1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline. 

1. From the main menu, select **Resources > Pipelines**.

1. Follow the directions displayed to setup a GitLab application.

    ![GitLab Pipeline Instructions]({{< baseurl >}}/img/rancher/gitlab-pipeline.png)

1. From GitLab, copy the **Application ID** and **Secret**. Paste them into Rancher.

1. If you're using GitLab for enterprise setup, select **Use a private gitlab enterprise installation**. Enter the host address of your GitLab installation.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

1. Enable the repository for which you want to run a pipeline. Then click **Done**.  

>**Note:** If you use GitLab and your Rancher setup is in a local network, enable the **Allow requests to the local network from hooks and services** option in GitLab admin settings.

**Result:** A pipeline is added to the project.

<!-- What happens if you change this value while builds are running? -->





### 2. Configuring Pipeline Stages and Steps

Now that the pipeline is added to your project, you need to configure its automated stages and steps. For your convenience, there are multiple built-in step types for dedicated tasks.

1. From your project's **Pipeline** tab, find your new pipeline, and select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config**.
    
    >**Note:** When configuring a pipeline, it takes a few moments for Rancher to check for an existing pipeline configuration.

1. Click **Configure pipeline for this branch**.
 
1. Add stages to your pipeline execution by clicking **Add Stage**.

1. Add steps to each stage by clicking **Add a Step**. You can add multiple steps to each stage.

    >**Note:** As you build out each stage and step, click `Show advanced options` to make [Advanced Configurations](#advanced-configuration), such as rules to trigger or skip pipeline actions, add environment variables, or inject environment variables using secrets. Advanced options are available the pipeline, each stage, and each individual step.

    **Step types available include:** 

    {{% accordion id="clone" label="Clone" %}}

The first stage is preserved to be a cloning step that checks out source code from your repo. Rancher handles the cloning of the git repository. This action is equivalent to `git clone <repository_link> <workspace_dir>`.

    {{% /accordion %}}
    {{% accordion id="run-script" label="Run Script" %}}

The **Run Script** step executes arbitrary commands in the workspace inside a specified container. You can use it to build, test and do more, given whatever utilities the base image provides. For your convenience you can use variables to refer to metadata of a pipeline execution. Please go to the [Pipeline Variable Reference]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/reference/#variable-substitution) for the list of available variables.

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "By UI" %}}
<br/>

1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Run Script** and fill in the form.

1. Click **Add**. 

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "By YAML" %}}

```yaml
# example
stages:
- name: Build something
  steps:
  - runScriptConfig:
      image: golang
      shellScript: go build
``` 
{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabs %}}     

{{% /accordion %}}
{{% accordion id="build-publish-image" label="Build and Publish Images" %}}

The **Build and Publish Image** step builds and publishes a Docker image. This process requires a Dockerfile in your source code's repository to complete successfully.

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "By UI" %}}
1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Build and Publish**.

1. Fill in the rest of the form. Descriptions for each field are listed below. When you're done, click **Add**.
 
    Field | Description |
    ---------|----------|
     Dockerfile Path | The relative path to the Dockerfile in the source code repo. By default, this path is `./Dockerfile`, which assumes the Dockerfile is in the root directory. You can set it to other paths in different use cases (`./path/to/myDockerfile` for example). | 
     Image Name | The image name in `name:tag` format. The registry address is not required. For example, to build  `example.com/repo/my-image:dev`, enter `repo/my-image:dev`. |
     Push image to remote repository | An option to set the registry that publishes the image that's built.  To use this option, enable it and choose a registry from the drop-down. If this option is disabled, the image is pushed to the internal registry. |
     Build Context <br/><br/> (**Show advanced options**)| By default, the root directory of the source code (`.`). For more details, see the Docker [build command documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "By YAML" %}}
```yaml
# example
stages:
- name: Publish Image
  steps:
  - publishImageConfig:
      dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
      buildContext: .
      tag: repo/app:v1
      pushRemote: true
      registry: example.com
```

You can use specific arguments for Docker daemon and the build. They are not exposed in the UI, but they are available in pipeline YAML format, as indicated in the example above. Available variables includes:

Variable Name           | Description
------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
PLUGIN_DRY_RUN          | Disable docker push
PLUGIN_DEBUG            | Docker daemon executes in debug mode
PLUGIN_MIRROR           | Docker daemon registry mirror
PLUGIN_INSECURE         | Docker daemon allows insecure registries
PLUGIN_BUILD_ARGS       | Docker build args, a comma separated list 

{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabs %}}

{{% /accordion %}}
{{% accordion id="deploy-yaml" label="Deploy YAML" %}}

This step deploys arbitrary Kubernetes resources to the project. This deployment requires a Kubernetes manifest file to be present in the source code repository. Pipeline variable substitution is supported in the manifest file. You can view an example file at [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/pipeline-example-go/blob/master/deployment.yaml). For available variables, refer to [Pipeline Variable Reference]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/reference/).

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "By UI" %}}

1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Deploy YAML** and fill in the form.

1. Enter the **YAML Path**, which is the path to the manifest file in the source code.

1. Click **Add**. 

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "By YAML" %}}

```yaml

``` 

{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabs %}}     

{{% /accordion %}}

1. When you're finished adding stages and steps, click **Done.** 

### 3. Running the Pipeline

Run your pipeline for the first time. From the **Pipeline** tab, find your pipeline and select **Ellipsis (...) > Run**.

During this initial run, your pipeline is tested, and the following [pipeline components]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/) are deployed to your project as workloads in a new namespace dedicated to the pipeline:

- `docker-registry`
- `jenkins`
- `minio`

This process takes several minutes. When it completes, you can view each pipeline component from the project **Workloads** tab.

### 4. Configuring Persistent Data for Pipeline Components

The internal [Docker registry]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/#reg) and the [Minio]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/#minio) workloads use ephemeral volumes by default. This default storage works out-of-the-box and makes testing easy, but you lose the build images and build logs if the node running the Docker Registry or Minio fails. In most cases this is fine. If you want build images and logs to survive node failures, you can configure the Docker Registry and Minio to use persistent volumes.

Complete both [A—Configuring Persistent Data for Docker Registry](#a—configuring-persistent-data-for-docker-registry) _and_ [B—Configuring Persistent Data for Minio](#b—configuring-persistent-data-for-minio).

>**Prerequisites (for both parts A and B):**
>
>[Persistent volumes]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/volumes-and-storage/#persistent-volumes) must be available for the cluster.

## Advanced Configuration

During the process of configuring a pipeline, you can configure advanced options for triggering the pipeline or configuring environment variables.

- [Configuring Pipeline Trigger Rules](#configuring-pipeline-trigger-rules)
- [Configuring Timeouts](#configuring-timeouts)
- [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables)
- [Configuring Pipeline Secrets](#configuring-pipeline-secrets)
- [Configuring the Executor Quota](#configuring-the-executor-quota)

### Configuring Pipeline Trigger Rules

When a repository is enabled, a webhook for it is automatically set in the version control system. By default, the project pipeline is triggered by a push event to a specific repository, but you can add (or change) events that trigger a build, such as a pull request or a tagging.

Trigger rules come in two types:

- **Run this when:**

    This type of rule starts the pipeline, stage, or step when a trigger explicitly occurs.

- **Do Not Run this when:**
 
    If all conditions evaluate to true, then the pipeline/stage/step is executed. Otherwise it is skipped. When a stage/step is skipped, it is considered successful and follow-up stages/steps continue to run. Wildcard character (`*`) expansion is supported in conditions.


{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "Pipeline Trigger" %}}

You can configure trigger rules for the entire pipeline in two different contexts:

      env:
        FIRST_KEY: VALUE
        SECOND_KEY: VALUE2
``` 
{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabs %}}

### Configuring Pipeline Secrets

If you need to use security-sensitive information in your pipeline scripts (like a password), you can pass them in using Kubernetes [secrets]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/secrets/).

>**Prerequisite:** Create a secret for your project for use in pipelines.

>**Note:** Secret injection is disabled on pull request events.

      - sourceName: my-secret
        sourceKey: secret-key
        targetKey: ALIAS_ENV
``` 
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

### Configuring the Executor Quota

The _executor quota_ decides how many builds can run simultaneously in the project. If the number of triggered builds exceeds the quota, subsequent builds will queue until a vacancy opens. By default, the quota is `2`, but you can change it.

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you've configured a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Resources > Pipelines**.

1. From `The maximum number of pipeline executors` increment the **Scale** up or down to change the quota. A value of `0` or less removes the quota limit.
