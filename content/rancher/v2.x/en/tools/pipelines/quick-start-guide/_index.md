2. Select workloads from the top level Nav bar.

5. Click the `Enable` button of an example repo, e.g., `https://github.com/rancher/pipeline-example-go.git`.

6. Click Done, you can see the repo under pipelines Nav bar. 

## Run Example Pipelines

1. Assuming you've enabled an example repository, go to pipelines Nav bar of the project.

2. Expand the action button of the enabled repository.

3. Click Run.
    
    >**Note:** When you are running a pipeline the first time, it will take a few minutes to pull relevant images and provision necessary pipeline components.
    To understand what the example pipeline is doing, you can check the `.rancher-pipeline.yml` file in the example repositories, or click `Edit Config` action of the enabled repository to see it via UI wizard.
