You can configure Rancher to send Kubernetes logs to a [Syslog](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) server.

## Configuring Syslog

You can configure Rancher to send cluster or project logs to Syslog.

>**Prerequisite:** You must have a Syslog server configured.

1. Browse to the cluster or project that you want to log.
{{% accordion id="cluster" label="To Configure Cluster Logging:" %}}
If you're a [cluster owner or member]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/#cluster-roles) who works in operations or security, configure cluster logging.

1. From the **Global** view, open the cluster that you want to configure logging for.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Logging**.

{{% accordion id="project" label="To Configure Project Logging:" %}}
If you're a [project owner or member]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/#project-roles) who works on an application, configure project logging.

1. From the **Global** view, open the project that you want to configure logging for.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Logging**. In versions prior to v2.2.0, you can choose **Resources > Logging**.

1. Select **Syslog**.

1. Complete the **Syslog Configuration** form.

    1. From the **Endpoint** field, enter the IP address and port for your Syslog server. Additionally, select the protocol that your Syslog server uses from the drop-down.

    1. From the **Program** field, enter the name of the application sending logs to your Syslog server (i.e., Rancher).

    1. If you are using a cloud logging service (i.e., [Sumologic](https://www.sumologic.com/)), enter a **Token** that authenticates with your Syslog server. Use the cloud logging service to create this token.

    1. Select a **Log Severity** for events that are logged to the Syslog server. For more information on each severity level, see the [Syslog protocol documentation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#page-11).

1. If your Syslog is using **TCP** protocol, you need to select **Use TLS** and complete the **SSL Configuration** form.

    1. Enter the private key and client certificate. You can either copy and paste them or upload them by **Read from a file**.

        You can use either a self-signed certificate or one provided by a certificate authority.

        You can generate a self-signed certificate using an openssl command. For example:
            
            openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.cert -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=myservice.example.com"

    1. Enter your private key password.

    1. If you are using a self-signed certificate, you need to select the **Enabled - Input trusted server certificate** option and enter your **CA Certificate PEM**.

    1. If you are using rsyslog, please make sure your rsyslog authentication mode is **x509/name**.

1. Complete the **Additional Logging Configuration** form.

    1. **Optional:** Use the **Add Field** button to add custom log fields to your logging configuration. These fields are key value pairs (such as `foo=bar`) that you can use to filter the logs from another system.
    
    1. Enter a **Flush Interval**. This value determines how often [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) flushes data to the logging server. Intervals are measured in seconds.

    1. **Include System Log**. The logs from pods in system project and RKE components will be sent to the target. Uncheck it to exclude the system logs.

1. Click **Test**. Rancher sends a test log to Syslog.

1. Click **Save**.

**Result:** Rancher is now configured to send logs to your Syslog server. View your Syslog stream to view logs for your cluster and containers.
