title: Backing up Rancher
weight: 1
---

In this section, you'll learn how to back up Rancher.

### 1. Install the `rancher-backup` operator

The backup storage location is an operator-level setting, so it needs to be configured when `rancher-backup` is installed or upgraded.

Backups are created as .tar.gz files. These files can be pushed to S3 or Minio, or they can be stored in a persistent volume.

1. In the Rancher UI, go to the **Cluster Explorer.**
1. Click **Apps.**
1. Click `rancher-backup`.
1. Configure the default storage location. For help, refer to the [storage configuration section.](#configuring-the-storage-location)

### 2. Perform a Backup

To perform a backup, a custom resource of type Backup must be created.

1. In the **Cluster Explorer,** go to the dropdown menu in the upper left corner and click **Rancher Backups.**
1. Click **Backup.**
1. Create the Backup with the form, or with YAML. For this example, we can click **Create > Create from YAML.** Enter the Backup YAML. This example Backup custom resource would create encrypted recurring backups in S3:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: resources.cattle.io/v1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: test-s3-recurring-backup
    spec:
      storageLocation:
        s3:
          credentialSecretName: s3-creds
          credentialSecretNamespace: default
          bucketName: rajashree-backup-test
          folder: ecm1
          region: us-west-2
          endpoint: s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
      resourceSetName: rancher-resource-set
      encryptionConfigSecretName: test-encryptionconfig
      schedule: "@every 2m"
      retentionCount: 3
      ```





    For help configuring the Backup, refer to the [configuration reference](../../configuration/backup-config) and to the [examples.](../../examples/backups)

    Recurring backups are scheduled by editing the `Schedule` and `RetentionCount` fields. For more information, refer to the [Backup configuration reference.](../../backup-config/#schedule)

    > **Important:** The `rancher-backup` operator doesn't save the EncryptionConfiguration file. The contents of the EncryptionConfiguration file must be saved when an encrypted backup is created, and the same file must be used when restoring from this backup.
1. Click **Create.**

**Result:** The backup file is created in the storage location configured in the Backup custom resource. The name of this file is used when performing a restore.
