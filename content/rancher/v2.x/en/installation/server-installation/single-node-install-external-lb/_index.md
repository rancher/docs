# Single Node Install with External Loadbalancer

For development environments, we recommend installing Rancher by running a single Docker container. In this installation scenario, you'll install Docker on a single Linux host, and then install Rancher on your host using a single Docker container.

>**Note:**
> If you want don't want to use an external loadbalancer, please see [Single Node Install]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-installation/single-node-install/).

## Provision Linux Host

Provision a single Linux host to launch your {{< product >}} Server.

### Requirements

{{< requirements_hardware >}}

{{< requirements_software >}}

>**Note:**
>- `rancher/rancher` is hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rancher/rancher/tags/). If you don't have access to DockerHub, or you are installing Rancher without an internet connection, refer to [Installing From a Private Registry]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap-installation/install-from-private-registry/).<br/><br/>
>- For a list of other Rancher Server tags available, refer to [Rancher Server Tags]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-tags/).

## Configuration

For security purposes, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is required when using Rancher. SSL secures all Rancher network communication which happens when you login or interact with a cluster for example.

You can choose from the following scenarios:

* [Self-Signed Certificate](#self-signed-certificate)
* [Certificate signed by a well known Certificate Authority](#certificate-signed-by-a-recognized-certificate-authority)

### Self signed certificate

When using self signed certificates on the loadbalancer/proxy, you still need to supply the CA certificate to the `rancher/rancher` container. This will be used to validate connections to Rancher.

| Type                         |        Location in container |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| CA certificates file         | /etc/rancher/ssl/cacerts.pem |

<u>Command to use:</u>

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v /etc/your_certificate_directory/cacerts.pem:/etc/rancher/ssl/cacerts.pem \
  rancher/rancher
```

### Certificate signed by a recognized Certificate Authority

If the certificate you want to use on the loadbalancer/proxy is signed by a recognized Certificate Authority, you will have to remove the default generated CA certificate information in Rancher. This can be done under `Settings` -> `cacerts`, choose `Edit` and remove the contents and click `Save`.

### Instructions for the loadbalancer or proxy

When using a loadbalancer or proxy in front of the `rancher/rancher` container, there is no need for the `rancher/rancher` container to redirect port **TCP/80** (HTTP) to port **TCP/443** (HTTPS). By passing the header `X-Forwarded-Proto:
 https` header, this redirect will be disabled.

The loadbalancer or proxy has to be configured to support the following:

* Support **WebSocket** connections
* **SPDY** / **HTTP/2** support
* Passing/setting the following headers

| Header               | Value                                     | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Host`               | Hostname that is used to reach Rancher | To identify the server requested by the client               |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto`  | `https`                                   | To identify the protocol that a client used to connect to the loadbalancer or proxy<br />*If this Header is present, `rancher/rancher` will not redirect HTTP to HTTPS* |
| `X-Forwarded-Port`   | Port used to reach Rancher                | To identify the protocol that client used to connect to the loadbalancer or proxy |
| `X-Forwarded-For`    | IP of the client connection               | To identify the originating IP address of a client           |


#### Example NGINX configuration

This NGINX configuration is tested on NGINX 1.13 (mainline) and 1.14 (stable)

```
upstream rancher {
    server rancher-server:80;
}

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default Upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name rancher.yourdomain.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/your_certificate_directory/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/your_certificate_directory/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass http://rancher;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        # This allows the ability for the execute shell window to remain open for up to 15 minutes. Without this parameter, the default is 1 minute and will automatically close.
        proxy_read_timeout 900s;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name rancher.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```
