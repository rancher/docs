This section contains information on how to install a Kubernetes cluster that the Rancher server can be installed on.

In Rancher prior to v2.4, the Rancher server needed to run on an RKE Kubernetes cluster.

In Rancher v2.4.x, Rancher need to run on either an RKE Kubernetes cluster or a K3s Kubernetes cluster.

In Rancher v2.5, Rancher can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
