This section contains instructions for installing Rancher in development and production environments.

Choose from the following installation options:

- [Single Node Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install)

	In this simple install scenario, you install Rancher on a single Linux host.

- [Single Node Installation with External Load Balancer]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install-external-lb)

	In this scenario, you install Rancher on a single Linux host and access it using an external load balancer/proxy.

-  [High Availablity Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha-server-install/)

 	This install scenario creates a new Kubernetes cluster dedicated to running Rancher Server in a high-availabilty (HA) configuration.

-  [High Availablity Installation with External Load Balancer]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha-server-install-external-lb)

 	This install scenario creates a new Kubernetes cluster dedicated to running Rancher Server in a high-availabilty (HA) configuration. A load balancer is placed in front of the HA configuration.

-  [Air Gap Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap-installation/)

 	We also have instructions for a more specialized use case where you install Rancher Server in an environment without an Internet connection.

-  [Operation behind a corporate proxy]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/behind-corporate-proxy/)

    If your rancher installation runs behind a corporate proxy, this page will provide you with information how to do that.
