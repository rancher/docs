## Install NGINX

Start by installing NGINX on your load balancer host. NGINX has packages available for all known operating systems.

For help installing NGINX, refer to their [install documentation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/).

## Create NGINX Configuration

After installing NGINX, you need to create the NGINX config file, `/etc/nginx/conf.d/rancher.conf`, with the IP addresses for your Linux nodes, chosen FQDN and location of the certificate file and certificate key file.

1. Copy and paste the code sample below into your favorite text editor. Save it as `/etc/nginx/conf.d/rancher.conf`.

    **Example NGINX config:**
    ```
    upstream rancher {
        server IP_NODE_1:80;
        server IP_NODE_2:80;
        server IP_NODE_3:80;
    }
    
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default Upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }
    
    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        server_name FQDN;
        ssl_certificate /certs/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /certs/privkey.pem;
    
        location / {
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_pass http://rancher;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            # This allows the ability for the execute shell window to remain open for up to 15 minutes. Without this parameter, the default is 1 minute and will automatically close.
            proxy_read_timeout 900s;
        }
    }
    
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name FQDN;
        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }
    ```

2. In `/etc/nginx/conf.d/rancher.conf`, replace `IP_NODE_1`, `IP_NODE_2`, and `IP_NODE_3` with the IPs of your Linux hosts.
3. In `/etc/nginx/conf.d/rancher.conf`, replace `FQDN` with the FQDN you chose for your Rancher installation.
4. In `/etc/nginx/conf.d/rancher.conf`, replace `/certs/fullchain.pem` with the path to your certificate. If there are intermediates required for you certificate, they should be included in this file.
5. In `/etc/nginx/conf.d/rancher.conf`, replace `/certs/privkey.pem` with the path to your certificate key.

## Run NGINX

* Reload or restart NGINX

    ````
    # Reload NGINX
    nginx -s reload

    # Restart NGINX
    # Depending on your Linux distribution
    service nginx restart
    systemctl restart nginx
    ````

## Browse to Rancher UI

You should now be to able to browse to `https://FQDN`.
