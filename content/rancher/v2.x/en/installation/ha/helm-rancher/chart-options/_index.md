### HTTP Proxy

Rancher requires internet access for some functionality (helm charts). Use `proxy` to set your proxy server.

Add your IP exceptions to the `noProxy` list. Make sure you add the Service cluster IP range (default: 10.43.0.1/16) and any worker cluster `controlplane` nodes. Rancher supports CIDR notation ranges in this list.

```
--set proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<proxy_url>:<proxy_port>/"
--set noProxy="127.0.0.1,localhost,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16"
```

### Private or Air Gap Registry

You can point to a private registry for an "Air Gap" install.

#### Images

Populate your private registry with Rancher images.

You can get the list of images required for rancher and worker cluster installs from the [Releases](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/latest) page.

#### Create Registry Secret

Use `kubectl` to create a docker-registry secret in the `cattle-system` namespace.

```
kubectl -n cattle-system create secret docker-registry regcred \
--docker-server="reg.example.com:5000" \
--docker-username=<user> \
--docker-password=<password> \
--docker-email=<email>
```

#### Registry Options

Add the `rancherImage` to point to your private registry image and `imagePullSecrets` to your install command.

```
--set rancherImage=reg.example.com:5000/rancher/rancher \
--set imagePullSecrets[0].name=regcred
```

### External TLS Termination

If you wish to terminate the SSL/TLS on a load-balancer external to the Rancher cluster (ingress), use the `--tls=external` option and point your load balancer at port http 80 on all of the rancher cluster nodes.

> NOTE: If you are using a Private CA signed cert, add `--set privateCA=true` and see [Adding TLS Secrets - Private CA Signed - Additional Steps](../tls-secrets/#private-ca-signed---additional-steps) to add the CA cert for Rancher.

Your load balancer must support long lived websocket connections and will need to insert proxy headers so Rancher can route links correctly.

> NOTE: The `tls=external` option will expose the Rancher interface on http port 80.  Clients that are allowed to connect directly to the Rancher cluster will not be encrypted. We recommend that you restrict direct access at the network level to just your load balancer.

#### Required headers

* `Host`
* `X-Forwarded-Proto`
* `X-Forwarded-Port`
* `X-Forwarded-For`

#### Health checks

Rancher will respond `200` to health checks on the `/healthz` endpoint.
