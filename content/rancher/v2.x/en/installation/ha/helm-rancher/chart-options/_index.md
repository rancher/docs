### API Audit Log

Enabling the [API Audit Log](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/api-auditing/).

You can collect this log as you would any container log. Enable the [Logging service under Rancher Tools](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/logging/) for the `System` Project on the Rancher server cluster.

```plain
--set auditLog.level=1
```

By default enabling Audit Logging will create a sidecar container in the Rancher pod. This container (`rancher-audit-log`) will stream the log to `stdout`.  You can collect this log as you would any container log. Enable the [Logging service under Rancher Tools](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/logging/) for the Rancher server cluster or System Project.

Set the `auditLog.destination` to `hostPath` to forward logs to volume shared with the host system instead of streaming to a sidecar container. When setting the destination to `hostPath` you may want to adjust the other auditLog parameters for log rotation.

### HTTP Proxy

Rancher requires internet access for some functionality (helm charts). Use `proxy` to set your proxy server.

Add your IP exceptions to the `noProxy` list. Make sure you add the Service cluster IP range (default: 10.43.0.1/16) and any worker cluster `controlplane` nodes. Rancher supports CIDR notation ranges in this list.

```plain
--set proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<proxy_url>:<proxy_port>/"
--set noProxy="127.0.0.0/8\,10.0.0.0/8\,172.16.0.0/12\,192.168.0.0/16"
```

### Additional Trusted CAs

If you have private registries, catalogs or a proxy that intercepts certificates, you may need to add additional trusted CAs to Rancher.

```plain
--set additionalTrustedCAs=true
```

Once the Rancher deployment is created, copy your CA certs in pem format into a file named `ca-additional.pem` and use `kubectl` to create the `tls-ca-additional` secret in the `cattle-system` namespace.

```plain
kubectl -n cattle-system create secret generic tls-ca-additional --from-file=ca-additional.pem
```

### Private Registry and Air Gap Installs

See [Installing Rancher - Air Gap]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap-installation/install-rancher/) for details on installing Rancher with a private registry.

### External TLS Termination

We recommend configuring your load balancer as a Layer 4 balancer, forwarding plain 80/tcp and 443/tcp to the Rancher Management cluster nodes. The Ingress Controller on the cluster will redirect http traffic on port 80 to https on port 443.

You may terminate the SSL/TLS on a L7 load balancer external to the Rancher cluster (ingress). Use the `--set tls=external` option and point your load balancer at port http 80 on all of the Rancher cluster nodes. This will expose the Rancher interface on http port 80. Be aware that clients that are allowed to connect directly to the Rancher cluster will not be encrypted. If you choose to do this we recommend that you restrict direct access at the network level to just your load balancer.

> **Note:** If you are using a Private CA signed cert, add `--set privateCA=true` and see [Adding TLS Secrets - Private CA Signed - Additional Steps]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha/helm-rancher/tls-secrets/#private-ca-signed---additional-steps) to add the CA cert for Rancher.

Your load balancer must support long lived websocket connections and will need to insert proxy headers so Rancher can route links correctly.

#### Required Headers

* `Host`
* `X-Forwarded-Proto`
* `X-Forwarded-Port`
* `X-Forwarded-For`

#### Recommended Timeouts

* Read Timeout: `1800 seconds`
* Write Timeout: `1800 seconds`
* Connect Timeout: `30 seconds`

#### Health Checks

Rancher will respond `200` to health checks on the `/healthz` endpoint.
