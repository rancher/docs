title: 1â€”Create Nodes and Load Balancer
weight: 185
---

Use your provider of choice to provision 3 nodes and a Load Balancer endpoint for your RKE install.

> **Note:** These nodes must be in the same region/datacenter.  You may place these servers in separate availability zones.

### Node Requirements

View the supported operating systems and hardware/software/networking requirements for nodes running Rancher at [Node Requirements]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements).

View the OS requirements for RKE at [RKE Requirements]({{< baseurl >}}/rke/v0.1.x/en/os/)

### Load Balancer

RKE will configure an Ingress controller pod, on each of your nodes. The Ingress controller pods are bound to ports TCP/80 and TCP/443 on the host network and are the entry point for HTTPS traffic to the Rancher server.

Configure a load balancer as a basic Layer 4 TCP forwarder. The exact configuration will vary depending on your environment.
