To debug issues around this error, you will need to download the command-line tool `kubectl`. See [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) how to download `kubectl` for your platform.

When you have made changes to `rancher-cluster.yml`, you will have to run `rke remove --config rancher-cluster.yml` to clean the nodes, so it cannot conflict with previous configuration errors.

<li>Is each of the base64 encoded certificate string placed directly after the key, for example: `tls.crt: LS01...`, there should be no newline/space before, in between or after.</li>
<li>Is the YAML properly formatted, each indentation should be 2 spaces as shown in the template files.</li>
<li>Verify the integrity of your certificate by running this command `cat MyCertificate | base64 -d` on Linux, `cat MyCertificate | base64 -D` on Mac OS . If any error exists, the command output will tell you.
</ul>
</ul>

# Windows
certutil -decode FILENAME.base64 FILENAME.verify
```

#### The Ingress "cattle-ingress-http" is invalid: spec.rules[0].host: Invalid value: "IP": must be a DNS name, not an IP address

The host value can only contain a host name, as it is needed by the ingress controller to match the hostname and pass to the correct backend.
