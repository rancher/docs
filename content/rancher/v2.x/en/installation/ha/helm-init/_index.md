title: 3 - Initialize Helm (Install tiller)

Helm is the package management tool of choice for Kubernetes. Helm "charts" provide templating syntax for Kubernetes YAML manifest documents. With Helm we can create configurable deployments instead of just using static files. For more information about creating your own catalog of deployments, check out the docs at [https://helm.sh/](https://helm.sh/). To be able to use Helm, the server-side component `tiller` needs to be installed on your cluster.

> **Note:** For systems without direct internet access see [Helm - Air Gap]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap-installation/install-rancher/#helm) for install details.

### Install Tiller on the Cluster

Helm installs the `tiller` service on your cluster to manage charts. Since RKE enables RBAC by default we will need to use `kubectl` to create a `serviceaccount` and `clusterrolebinding` so `tiller` has permission to deploy to the cluster.

* Create the `ServiceAccount` in the `kube-system` namespace.
* Create the `ClusterRoleBinding` to give the `tiller` account access to the cluster.
* Finally use `helm` to install the `tiller` service

```plain
kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount tiller

kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin \
  --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller

helm init --service-account tiller
```

> **Note:** This `tiller` install has full cluster access, which should be acceptable if the cluster is dedicated to Rancher server. Check out the [helm docs](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#role-based-access-control) for restricting `tiller` access to suit your security requirements.

### Test your Tiller installation

Run the following command to verify the installation of `tiller` on your cluster:

```
kubectl -n kube-system  rollout status deploy/tiller-deploy
Waiting for deployment "tiller-deploy" rollout to finish: 0 of 1 updated replicas are available...
deployment "tiller-deploy" successfully rolled out
```

And run the following command to validate Helm can talk to the `tiller` service:

```
helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.11.0", GitCommit:"2e55dbe1fdb5fdb96b75ff144a339489417b146b", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.11.0", GitCommit:"2e55dbe1fdb5fdb96b75ff144a339489417b146b", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```
