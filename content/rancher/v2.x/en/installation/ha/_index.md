title: High Availability Installation
weight: 275

When installed in a Kubernetes cluster, Rancher will integrate with the cluster's etcd database and take advantage of Kubernetes scheduling for High-Availability.

This procedure walks you through setting up a 3-node cluster with RKE and installing the Rancher chart with the Helm package manager.

> **Note:** For the best performance, we recommend this Kubernetes cluster be dedicated only to the Rancher workload.

## Recommended Architecture

* DNS for Rancher should resolve to a Layer 4 Load Balancer
* The Load Balancer should forward ports 80 and 443 TCP to all 3 nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.
* The Ingress controller will redirect http port 80 to https and terminate SSL/TLS on port 443.
* The Ingress controller will forward traffic to port 80 on the Pod in the Rancher Deployment.
