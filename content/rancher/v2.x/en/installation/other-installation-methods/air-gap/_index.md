This section is about installations of Rancher server in an air gapped environment. An air gapped environment could be where Rancher server will be installed offline, behind a firewall, or behind a proxy.

The installation steps differ depending on whether Rancher is installed on an RKE Kubernetes cluster, a K3s Kubernetes cluster, or a single Docker container.

For more information on each installation option, refer to [this page.]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/)

Throughout the installation instructions, there will be _tabs_ for each installation option.

> **Important:** If you install Rancher following the Docker installation guide, there is no upgrade path to transition your Docker Installation to a Kubernetes Installation.
