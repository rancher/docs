# Installing From a Private Registry

Rancher supports installing from a private registry. In every [release](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases), we provide you with the needed system-images and scripts to mirror those images to your own registry. The system-images are used when nodes are added to a cluster, or when you enable features like pipelines or logging.

>**Prerequisite:** It is assumed you either have your own private registry or other means of distributing docker images to your machine. If you need help with creating a private registry, please refer to the [Docker documentation for private registries](https://docs.docker.com/registry/).


>**Note:** In Rancher v2.0.0, registries with authentication are not supported for installing from a private registry. The system-images can only be pulled from a registry without authentication enabled. This limitation only applies to system-images. See [Configure Registry for Workloads](#dummy) how to configure private registries for your workloads.

## Release files

* **rancher-images.txt**: Contains all images needed for that release.
* **rancher-save-images.sh**: This script will pull all needed images from DockerHub, and save all of the images as a compressed file called `rancher-images.tar.gz`. This file can be transferred to your on-premise host that can access your private registry.
* **rancher-load-images.sh**: This script will load images from rancher-images.tar.gz and push them to your private registry. You have to supply the hostname of your private registry as first argument to the script.<br/>`rancher-load-images.sh registry.yourdomain.com:5000`

### Making the Rancher images available

We will cover two scenarios:

* **Scenario 1**: You have one host that can access DockerHub to pull and save the images, and a separate host that access your private registry to push the images.
* **Scenario 2**: You have one host that can access both DockerHub and your private registry.

#### Scenario 1: One host that can access DockerHub, separate host that can access private registry

1. Browse to the release page of your version (i.e. `https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.0.0`) and download `rancher-save-images.sh` and `rancher-load-images.sh`

2. Transfer and run `rancher-save-images.sh` on the host the can access DockerHub. This will require at least 20GB of disk space.

3. Transfer the output file from step 2 (`rancher-images.tar.gz`) to the host that can access the private registry.

4. Transfer and run `rancher-load-images.sh` on the host that can access the private registry. It should be run in the same directory as `rancher-images.tar.gz`.

#### Scenario 2: You have one host that can access both DockerHub and your private registry.

1. Browse to the release page of your version (i.e. `https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.0.0`) and download `rancher-images.txt`

2. Pull all the images present in `rancher-images.txt`, re-tag each image with the location of your registry, and push the image to the registry. This will require at least 20GB of disk space. See an example script below:

```
#!/bin/sh
IMAGES=`curl -s -L https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/download/v2.0.0/rancher-images.txt`
for IMAGE in $IMAGES; do
    until docker inspect $IMAGE > /dev/null 2>&1; do
        docker pull $IMAGE
    done
    docker tag $IMAGE registry.yourdomain.com:5000/$IMAGE
    docker push registry.yourdomain.com:5000/$IMAGE
done
```

### Configuring Rancher to use the private registry

Rancher needs to be configured to use the private registry as source for the needed images.

1. Go into the Settings view.
2. Look for the setting called `system-default-registry` and choose **Edit**.
3. Change the value to your registry, i.e. `registry.yourdomain.com:5000`. Do not prefix the registry with `http://` or `https://`

If you want to configure the setting when starting the rancher/rancher container, you can use the environment variable `CATTLE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_REGISTRY`. Example:

```
#!/bin/sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -e CATTLE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_REGISTRY=registry.yourdomain.com:5000 registry.yourdomain.com:5000/rancher/rancher:v2.0.0
```
