# Load Balancer Configuration

Following {{< product >}} installation, you have the option of configuring an external load balancer to direct cluster traffic.

Rancher has tested a few load balancer configurations. Choose from the options available. There is no "best" configuration. Choose the load balancer that best suits your needs.

When configuring an external load balancer, the steps for setting up a load balancer vary based on your install: single-node or high-availability.
