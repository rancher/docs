Rancher provides two ways for you to access your clusters. One is through kubectl shell, another is by setting your own kubeconfig file. Both of them are available in UI.

## Using kubectl Shell
Navigate to the **Clusters** page, a list of existing clusters will be shown there. Choose a cluster you want to access to. Click that cluster name will lead you to that cluster's page. As you can see, a **Launch kubectl**  button is in the top right corner. Click it for you to access this cluster through kubectl shell.

## Configuring My kubectl

You can also customize kubectl by clicking **Kubeconfig file** button in the top right corner, and then provide your own kubeconfig file.
