## Adding SSL Certificates

SSL certificates can be added at both, Project and Namespace level. A project scoped certificate will be available in all its namespaces. 

1. Select the project you want to add Certificates in UI under Global dropdown. 
2. Under Resources dropdown, select Certificates.
3. Click on Add Certificate option and give it a name. 
4. If you don't want the certificate to be available in all namespaces, Select the **Available to a single namespace** option. 
	- Choose the desired namespace. You can also add a new namespace by clicking on Add to a new namespace on the top of the namespace bar.
5. Copy-paste or use the **Read From File** option to upload your Private Key and Certificates. 

Note: Certificates are just kubernetes Secrets of type TLS, so their names shouldn't be same as any existing secret or private registry.
