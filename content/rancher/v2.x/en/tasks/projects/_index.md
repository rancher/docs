## Enabling Project Logging

Logging for individual projects can be configured separately from logging at the cluster level. 

1. Select the project that you want to enable logging for.

2. From the navigation menu, select **Resources > Logging**.

3. Choose the service that you want to use to log your project. Then complete the form.

  >**Notes:**
  >
  >* The configured logging service must be available and ready to access through its endpoint.
  >* Custom log fields (key/value pairs) can be included in the forwarded logs to assist in filtering. These are available    to all logging targets.


4. Click **Save**.

**Result:** After a brief period of time, logs originating from the project are forwarded to the configured target.
