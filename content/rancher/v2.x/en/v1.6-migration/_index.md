title: Migrating from Rancher v1.6 Cattle to v2.x
weight: 10000
---

Rancher 2.0 has been rearchitected and rewritten with the goal of providing a complete management solution for Kubernetes and Docker.  Due to these extensive changes, there is no direct upgrade path from 1.6.x to 2.x, but rather a migration of your 1.6 application workloads into the 2.0 Kubernetes equivalent.  In 1.6, the most common orchestration used was Rancher's own engine called Cattle. The following blogs (that will be converted in an official guide)  explain and educate our Cattle users on running workloads in a Kubernetes environment.  

If you are an existing Kubernetes user on Rancher 1.6, you only need to review the [Get Started](#1-get-started) section to prepare you on what to expect on a new 2.0 Rancher cluster.

## Kubernetes Basics

Rancher 2.0 is built on the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer&level=foundational) container orchestrator. This shift in underlying technology for 2.0 is a large departure from 1.6, which supported several popular container orchestrators. Since Rancher is now based entirely on Kubernetes, it's helpful to learn the Kubernetes basics.

The following table introduces and defines some key Kubernetes concepts.

| **Concept** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster     | A collection of machines that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.                                                                                                             |
| Namespace   | A virtual cluster, multiple of which can be supported by a single physical cluster.                                                                                                           |
| Node        | One of the physical (or virtual) machines that make up a cluster.                                                                                                                                |
| Pod         | The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a set of running [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/#why-containers) on your cluster. |
| Deployment  | An API object that manages a replicated application.                                                                                                                                          |
| Workload    | Units of work that are running on the cluster, these can be pods or deployments.                                                                                                             |


## Migration Cheatsheet

Because Rancher 1.6 defaulted to our Cattle container orchestrator, it primarily used terminology related to Cattle. However, because Rancher 2.0 uses Kubernetes, it aligns with the Kubernetes naming standard. This shift could be confusing for people unfamiliar with Kubernetes, so we've created a table that maps terms commonly used in Rancher 1.6 to their equivalents in Rancher 2.0.

| **Rancher 1.6** | **Rancher 2.0** |
| --- | --- |
| Container | Pod | 
| Services | Workload |
| Load Balancer | Ingress |
| Stack | Namespace | 
| Environment | Project (Administration)/Cluster (Compute)
| Host | Node | 
| Catalog | Helm |

More detailed information on Kubernetes concepts can be found in the
[Kubernetes Concepts Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/).

## 1. Get Started

As a Rancher 1.6 user who's interested in moving to 2.0, how should you get started with migration? The following blog provides a short checklist to help with this transition.

Blog Post: [Migrating from Rancher 1.6 to Rancher 2.0â€”A Short Checklist](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-08-09-migrate-1dot6-setup-to-2dot0/)

## 2. Run Migration Tools

To help with migration from 1.6 to 2.0, Rancher has developed migration-tools. Running this tool will help you export docker compose files and check if your Rancher 1.6 applications can be migrated to 2.0. If an application can't be migrated, the tool will help you identify what's lacking. 

This tool will:

- `export` docker compose files (i.e., `docker-compose.yml` and `rancher-compose.yml`) from your stacks running on `cattle` enviroments at your Rancher 1.6 system. For every stack, files are exported in `<export-dir>/<env_name>/<stack_name>` folder. For export all environments, you'll need an admin API key.

- `parse` docker compose files that you've exported from your Rancher 1.6 Stacks and output a list of constructs present in the Compose files that cannot be supported by Kubernetes in Rancher 2.0. These constructs require special handling or are parameters that cannot be converted to Kubernetes YAML, even using tools like Kompose.

### A. Download the Migration Tools

The Migration Tools for your platform can be downloaded from its [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/rancher/migration-tools/releases). The tool is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms.


### B. Configure the Migration Tools

After the tool is downloaded, you need to make some configurations to run it.

1. Modify the Migration Tool file to make it an executable.

    1. Open Terminal and change to the directory that contains the Migration Tool file.

    1. Rename the Migration Tool file to `migration-tools` so that it no longer includes the platform name.

    1. Enter the following command to make `migration-tools` an executable:
    
        ```
        chmod +x migration-tools
        ``` 

### C. Run the Migration Tools

The Migration Tools has implemented 2 commands, that could be used to: 

1. `export` docker compose files from stacks running on `cattle` environments at Rancher 1.6 system. 

1. `parse` exported docker compose files to get k8s yaml manifests and output a list of constructs present in the Compose files that cannot be supported by Kubernetes in Rancher 2.0.

```
# migration-tools -h
NAME:
   Rancher 1.6 to Rancher 2.0 migration-helper - Please check the options using --help flag

USAGE:
   migration-tools [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   git

AUTHOR:
   Rancher Labs, Inc.

COMMANDS:
     export   Export compose files for every stack running on cattle environment on a Rancher v1.6 system
     parse    Parse docker-compose and rancher-compose files to get k8s manifests
     help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --debug        debug logging
   --log value    path to log to
   --help, -h     show help
   --version, -v  print the version
```

#### Export command

You can use the Migration Tool to `export` docker compose files of all your  stacks running on `cattle` environments at Rancher 1.6 system. 

```
# migration-tools export -h
NAME:
   migration-tools export - Export compose files for every stack running on cattle environment on a Rancher v1.6 system

USAGE:
   migration-tools export [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --url value         Rancher API endpoint URL [$RANCHER_URL]
   --access-key value  Rancher API access key. Using admin API key will export stacks on all cattle environments [$RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY]
   --secret-key value  Rancher API secret key [$RANCHER_SECRET_KEY]
   --export-dir value  Base directory under which compose files will be exported under sub-directories created for every env/stack (default: "export")
   --all, -a           Export all stacks. Using this flag stacks with inactive, stopped and removing state, will also be exported
   --system, -s        Export system and infrastructure stacks
```

Execute the following command, replacing each placeholder with your values.

```
migration-tools export --url <RANCHER_URL> --access-key <RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY> --secret-key <RANCHER_SECRET_KEY> --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR>
```

#### Parse command

You can use the Migration Tools to `parse` docker compose files exported from each stack that you want to migrate. 

```
# migration-tools parse -h
NAME:
   migration-tools parse - Parse docker-compose and rancher-compose files to get k8s manifests

USAGE:
   migration-tools parse [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --docker-file value   Docker compose file to parse to get k8s manifest (default: "docker-compose.yml")
   --output-file value   Output file where to write checks and advices for conversion (default: "output.txt")
   --rancher-file value  Rancher compose file to parse to get k8s manifest (default: "rancher-compose.yml")
```

Execute the following command, replacing each placeholder with the absolute path to your Stack's compose files. If you want to migrate multiple stacks, you'll have to re-run the command for each pair of compose files that you exported.

```
migration-tools parse --docker-file <DOCKER_COMPOSE_ABSOLUTE_PATH> --rancher-file <RANCHER_COMPOSE_ABSOLUTE_PATH>
```                                                         |

><sup>1</sup> If you omit the `--docker-file` and `--rancher-file` options from your command, the migration tools will check its home directory for compose files.

#### Output

After you run the migration tools parse command, the following files output to the same directory that you ran the tool from.


| Output                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output.txt`          | This file lists all constructs for each service in `docker-compose.yml` that requires special handling to be successfully migrated to Rancher 2.0. Each construct links to the relevant blog articles on how to implement it in Rancher 2.0 (these articles are also listed below). |
| Kubernetes YAML specs | The Migration Tool internally invokes [Kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose) to generate Kubernetes YAML specs for each service you're migrating to 2.0. Each YAML spec file is named for the service you're migrating.

## 3. Migrate Applications

In Rancher 1.6, you launch applications as _services_ and organize them under _stacks_ in an _environment_, which represents a compute and administrative boundary. Rancher 1.6 supports the Docker compose standard and provides import/export for application configurations using the following files: `docker-compose.yml` and `rancher-compose.yml`. In 2.0 the environment concept doesn't exist. Instead it's replaced by:

- **Cluster:** The compute boundary.
- **Project:** An administrative boundary.

The following article explores how to map Cattle's stack and service design to Kubernetes. It also demonstrates how to migrate a simple application from Rancher 1.6 to 2.0 using either the Rancher UI or Docker Compose.

## 4. Expose Your Services

In Rancher 1.6, you could provide external access to your applications using port mapping. This article explores how to publicly expose your services in Rancher 2.0. It explores both UI and CLI methods to transition the port mapping functionality.

Blog Post: [From Cattle to Kubernetesâ€”How to Publicly Expose Your Services in Rancher 2.0](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/expose-and-monitor-workloads/)

## 5. Monitor Your Applications

Rancher 1.6 provided TCP and HTTP healthchecks using its own healthcheck microservice. Rancher 2.0 uses native Kubernetes healthcheck support instead. This article overviewsÂ how to configure it in Rancher 2.0.

Blog Post: [From Cattle to Kubernetesâ€”Application Healthchecks in Rancher 2.0](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-08-22-k8s-monitoring-and-healthchecks/)

## 6. Schedule Deployments

Scheduling application containers on available resources is a key container orchestration technique. The following blog reviews how to schedule containers in Rancher 2.0 for those familiar with 1.6 scheduling labels (such as affinity and anti-affinity). It also explores how to launch a global service in 2.0.

Blog Post: [From Cattle to Kubernetesâ€”Scheduling Workloads in Rancher 2.0](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-08-29-scheduling-options-in-2-dot-0/)

## 7. Service Discovery

Rancher 1.6 provides service discovery within and across stacks using its own internal DNS microservice. It also supports pointing to external services and creating aliases. Moving to Rancher 2.0, you can replicate this same service discovery behavior. The following blog reviews this topic and the solutions needed to achieve service discovery parity in Rancher 2.0.

Blog Post: [From Cattle to Kubernetesâ€”Service Discovery in Rancher 2.0](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-09-04-service_discovery_2dot0/)

## 8. Load Balancing

How to achieve TCP/HTTP load balancing and configure hostname/path-based routing in Rancher 2.0.

Blog Post: [From Cattle to Kubernetes-How to Load Balance Your Services in Rancher 2.0](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-09-13-load-balancing-options-2dot0/)

In Rancher 1.6, a Load Balancer was used to expose your applications from within the Rancher environment for external access. In Rancher 2.0, the concept is the same. There is a Load Balancer option to expose your services. In the language of Kubernetes, this function is more often referred to as an **Ingress**. In short, Load Balancer and Ingress play the same role.
