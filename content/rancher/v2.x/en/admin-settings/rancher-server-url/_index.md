The first time that you log into Rancher, the system prompts you for the Rancher Server URL, which is the IP address or host name that any Kubernetes nodes must be able to resolve to.

If you need to update this URL, select **Settings** from the **Global** view.

### When Should I Update the Rancher Server URL?

If the URL of your Rancher Server changes, you must update the Rancher Server URL so that your nodes can continue communicating with the Rancher.
