Within Rancher, each user authenticates as a _user_, which is a login that grants you access to Rancher. As mentioned in [Authentication]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/concepts/global-configuration/authentication), users can either be local or external.

After you configure external authentication, the users that display on the **Users** page changes.

- If you are logged in as a local user, only local users display.

- If you are logged in an an external user, both external and local users display.

## Users and Roles

Once the user logs in to Rancher, their _authorization_, or their access rights within the system, is determined by _global permissions_, and _cluster and project roles_.  

- **Global Permissions:**

    Define user authorization outside the scope of any particular cluster.

- **Cluster and Project Roles:**

    Define user authorization inside the specific cluster or project where they are assigned the role.

Both global permissions and cluster and project roles are implemented on top of [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). Therefore, enforcement of permissions and roles is performed by Kubernetes.

### Global Permissions

Global Permissions define user authorization outside the scope of any particular cluster. Out-of-the-box, there are two default global permissions: `Administrator` and `Standard User`.

- **Administrator:**

    These users have full control over the entire Rancher system and all clusters within it.

- **Standard User:**

    These users can create new clusters and use them. Standard users can also assign other users permissions to their clusters.

>**Note:** You cannot create, update, or delete Global Permissions.

#### Global Permission Assignment

Assignment of global permissions to a user depends on their authentication source: external or local.

- **External Authentication**

    When a user logs into Rancher using an external authentication provider for the first time, they are automatically assigned the `Standard User` global permission.

- **Local Authentication**

    When you create a new local user, you assign them a global permission as you complete the **Add User** form.

#### Custom Global Permissions

Rather than assigning users the default global permissions of `Administrator` or `Standard User`, you can assign them a custom set of permissions.

_Permissions_ are individual access rights that you can assign when selecting a custom permission for a user.

Using custom permissions is convenient for providing users with narrow or specialized access to Rancher. See the [table below](#global-permissions-reference) for a list of individual permissions available.

#### Global Permissions Reference

The following table lists each custom global permission available and whether it is assigned to the default global permissions, `Administrator` and `Standard User`.

| Custom Global Permission           | Administrator | Standard User |

> **Note:** Each permission listed above is comprised of multiple individual permissions not listed in the Rancher UI. For a full list of these permissions and the rules they are comprised of, access through the API at `/v3/globalroles`.

### Cluster and Project Roles

Cluster and project roles define user authorization inside a cluster or project. You can manage these roles from the **Global > Security > Roles** page. From this page you can:

- Create and manage new roles for use across all clusters and projects
- [Lock/unlock roles](#locked-roles) so that they may not be used in any new role assignments (existing assignments will still be enforced).


#### Membership and Role Assignment

The projects and clusters accessible to non-administrative users is determined by _membership_. Membership is a list of users who have access to a specific cluster or project based on the roles they were assigned in that cluster or project. Each cluster and project includes a tab that a user with the appropriate permissions can use to manage membership.

When you create a cluster or project, Rancher automatically assigns you as the `Owner` for it. Users assigned the `Owner` role can assign other users roles in the cluster or project.

> **Note:** Non-administrative users cannot access any existing projects/clusters by default. A user with appropriate permissions (typically the owner) must explicitly assign the user membership.

#### Cluster Roles

_Cluster roles_ are roles that you can assign to users, granting them access to a cluster. There are two primary cluster roles: `Owner` and `Member`.

- **Owner:**

    These users have full control over the cluster and all resources in it.

- **Member:**

    These users can view most cluster level resources and create new projects.

##### Custom Cluster Roles

Rancher lets you assign _custom cluster roles_ to a user instead of the typical `Owner` or `Member` roles. These roles can be either a built-in custom cluster role or one defined by a Rancher administrator. They are convenient for defining narrow or specialized access for a user within a cluster. See the table below for a list of built-in custom cluster roles.

##### Cluster Role Reference

The following table lists each built-in custom cluster role available in Rancher and whether it is also granted by the `Owner` or `Member` role.

| Custom Cluster Role                | Owner         | Member        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Manage Cluster Members             | ✓             |               |
| Manage Nodes                       | ✓             |               |
| Manage Storage                     | ✓             |               |

| View Nodes                         | ✓             | ✓             |

> **Note:** Each cluster role listed above, including `Owner` and `Member`, is comprised of multiple rules granting access to various resources. You can view the roles and their rules on the Global > Security > Roles page.

#### Project Roles

_Project roles_ are roles that can be used to grant users access to a project. There are three primary project roles: `Owner`, `Member`, and `Read Only`.

- **Owner:**

    These users have full control over the project and all resources in it.

- **Member:**

    These users can manage project-scoped resources like namespaces and workloads, but cannot manage other project members.

- **Read Only:**

    These users can view everything in the project but cannot create, update, or delete anything.

##### Custom Project Roles

Rancher lets you assign _custom project roles_ to a user instead of the typical `Owner`, `Member`, or `Read Only` roles. These roles can be either a built-in custom project role or one defined by a Rancher administrator. They are convenient for defining narrow or specialized access for a user within a project. See the table below for a list of built-in custom project roles.

##### Project Role Reference

The following table lists each built-in custom project role available in Rancher and whether it is also granted by the `Owner`, `Member`, or `Read Only` role.

> **Note:** Each project role listed above, including Owner, Member, and Read Only, is comprised of multiple rules granting access to various resources. You can view the roles and their rules on the Global > Security > Roles page.

### Defining Custom Roles
As previously mentioned, custom roles can be defined for use at the cluster or project level. The context field defines whether the role will appear on the cluster member page, project member page, or both.

When defining a custom role, you can grant access to specific resources or specify roles from which the custom role should inherit. A custom role can be made up of a combination of specific grants and inherited roles. All grants are additive. This means that defining a narrower grant for a specific resource **will not** override a broader grant defined in a role that the custom role is inheriting from.

#### Locked Roles

You can set roles to a status of `locked`. Locking roles prevent them from being assigned users in the future.

Locked roles:

- Cannot be assigned to users that don't already have it assigned.
- Are not listed in the **Member Roles** drop-down when you are adding a user to a cluster or project.
- Do not affect users assigned the role before you lock the role. These users retain access that the role provides.

    **Example:** let's say your organization creates an internal policy that users assigned to a cluster are prohibited from creating new projects. It's your job to enforce this policy.

    To enforce it, before you add new users to the cluster, you should lock the following roles: `Cluster Owner`, `Cluster Member`, and `Create Projects`. Then you could create a new custom role that includes the same permissions as a __Cluster Member__, except the ability to create projects. Then, you use this new custom role when adding users to a cluster.

Roles can be locked by the following users:

- Any user assigned the `Administrator` global permission.
- Any user assigned the `Custom Users` permission, along with the `Manage Roles` role.
