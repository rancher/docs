Within Rancher, _roles_ determine what actions a user can make within a cluster or project.

Note that _roles_ are different from _permissions_, which determine what clusters and projects you can access.

## Adding A Custom Role

While Rancher comes out-of-the-box with a set of default user roles, you can also create default custom roles to provide users with very specific permissions within Rancher.

1.    From the **Global** view, select **Security > Roles** from the main menu.

2.    Select either **Cluster** or **Project**  then click **Add Role**.

3.	**Name** the role.

4.	Choose whether to set the role to a status of [locked]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/locked-roles/).

	Locked roles cannot be assigned to users.
  
5. Choose whether to set the role as the default for the creator.

6.	Use the **Grant Resources** options to assign individual [Kubernetes API endpoints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/) to the role.

	You can also choose the individual cURL methods (`Create`, `Delete`, `Get`, etc.) available for use with each endpoint you assign.

7.	Use the **Inherit from a Role** options to assign individual Rancher roles to your custom roles.

8.    Click **Create**.
