When you deploy Rancher and use it to provision clusters, Rancher installs its components on the nodes you use. This section features instructions on how to clean Rancher's components from your nodes that you no longer want to use with Rancher. 

There are two contexts in which you'd remove Rancher from a Kubernetes cluster node.

- [Removing Rancher from Your Rancher Cluster Nodes]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/removing-rancher/rancher-cluster-nodes/)

    In this context, you are removing Rancher from the Kubernetes cluster that your configured for your Rancher installation.

- [Removing Rancher from User Cluster Nodes]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/removing-rancher/user-cluster-nodes/)

    In this context, you are removing Rancher from Kubernetes clusters that you provisioned using Rancher.
