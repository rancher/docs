_Pod Security Policies_ (or PSPs) are objects that control security-sensitive aspects of pod specification (like root privileges). If a pod does not meet the conditions specified in the PSP, Kubernetes will not allow it to start, and Rancher will display an error message of `Pod <NAME> is forbidden: unable to validate...`.

- You can assign PSPs at the cluster or project level.
- PSPs work through inheritance.

    - By default, PSPs assigned to a cluster are inherited by its projects, as well as any namespaces added to those projects.
    - **Exception:** Namespaces that are not assigned to projects do not inherit PSPs, regardless of whether the PSP is assigned to a cluster or project. Because these namespaces have no PSPs, workload deployments to these namespaces will fail, which is the default Kubernetes behavior.
    - You can override the default PSP by assigning a different PSP directly to the project.
- Any workloads that are already running in a cluster or project before a PSP is assigned will not be checked if it complies with the PSP. Workloads would need to be cloned or upgraded to see if they pass the PSP.

>**Best Practice:**
>Set Pod Security at the cluster level.
