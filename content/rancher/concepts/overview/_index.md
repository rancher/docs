## What's Rancher?

Rancher is a container management platform built for organizations that deploy containers in production. Rancher makes it easy to run Kubernetes everywhere, meet IT requirements, and empower DevOps teams.

Run Kubernetes Everywhere. Kubernetes is not only the de-facto container orchestration standard, it is rapidly becoming a form of standard infrastructure available from all cloud and virtualization vendors. Rancher users have the choice of creating Kubernetes clusters with Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE), cloud Kubernetes services like GKE, AKS, and EKS. Rancher users can also import and manage their existing Kubernetes clusters created using any Kubernetes distributions or installers.

Meet IT Requirements. Rancher supports centralized authentication for all Kubernetes clusters under management. An employee of a large enterprise, for example, can use his corporate Active Directory credential to gain access to Kubernetes clusters in GKE. IT administrators can setup and enforce access control and security policies across all users, groups, projects, clusters, and clouds. IT administrators have a single-pane-of-glass view of the health and capacity of all their Kubernetes clusters.

Empower DevOps Teams. Rancher provides an intuitive user interface for DevOps engineers to manage their application workload. The user does not need to have in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes concepts to start using Rancher. Rancher catalog contains a set of useful DevOps tools. Rancher is certified with a wide selection of cloud native ecosystem products, including, for example, security tools, monitoring systems, container registries, and storage and networking drivers.
The following figure illustrates the role Rancher plays in IT and DevOps organizations. Each team deploys their applications on the public or private clouds they choose. IT administrators gain visibility and enforce policies across all users, clusters, and clouds.

## What's New?

The previous version, Rancher 1.6, was a container management platform built on docker. Rancher 2.0 build on the success and experience of Rancher 1.6 but bulk of the system has been rearchitected to work on Kubernetes. Rancher 2.0 retains the ease-of-use of Rancher 1.6 UI and catalog. Rancher 2.0 includes many new features such as the built-in CI pipeline, alerts and log aggregation, multi-cluster management, RKE, and integration with cloud Kubernetes services such as GKE, EKS, and AKS.
