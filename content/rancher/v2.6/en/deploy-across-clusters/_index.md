### Fleet

Rancher v2.5 introduced Fleet, a new way to deploy applications across clusters.

Fleet is GitOps at scale. For more information, refer to the [Fleet section.](./fleet)

### Multi-cluster Apps

In Rancher before v2.5, the multi-cluster apps feature was used to deploy applications across clusters. The multi-cluster apps feature is deprecated, but still available in Rancher v2.5.

Refer to the documentation [here.](./multi-cluster-apps)
