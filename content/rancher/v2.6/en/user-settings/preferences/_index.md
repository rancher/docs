Each user can choose preferences to personalize their Rancher experience. To change preference settings, open the **User Settings** menu and then select **Preferences**.

## Theme

Choose your background color for the Rancher UI. If you choose **Auto**, the background color changes from light to dark at 6 PM, and then changes back at 6 AM.

## My Account

This section displays the **Name** (your display name) and **Username** (your login) used for your session. To change your login's current password, click the **Change Password** button.

## Table Row per Page

On pages that display system objects like clusters or deployments in a table, you can set the number of objects that display on the page before you must paginate. The default setting is `50`.
