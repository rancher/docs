If your organization uses Okta Identity Provider (IdP) for user authentication, you can configure Rancher to allow your users to log in using their IdP credentials.

>**Note:** Okta integration only supports Service Provider initiated logins.

## Prerequisites

In Okta, create a SAML Application with the settings below. See the [Okta documentation](https://developer.okta.com/standards/SAML/setting_up_a_saml_application_in_okta) for help.

Setting | Value    
------------|------------
`Single Sign on URL` | `https://yourRancherHostURL/v1-saml/okta/saml/acs`
`Audience URI (SP Entity ID)` | `https://yourRancherHostURL/v1-saml/okta/saml/metadata`

## Configuring Okta in Rancher

1.	In the top left corner, click **â˜° > Users & Authentication**.
1. In the left navigation menu, click **Auth Provider**.
1. Click **Okta**.
1.	Complete the **Configure Okta Account** form. The examples below describe how you can map Okta attributes from attribute statements to fields within Rancher.

    | Field                     | Description                                                                   |
    | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Display Name Field        | The attribute name from an attribute statement that contains the display name of users.                        |
    | User Name Field           | The attribute name from an attribute statement that contains the user name/given name.                         |
    | UID Field                 | The attribute name from an attribute statement that is unique to every user.                                    |
    | Groups Field              | The attribute name in a group attribute statement that exposes your groups.        |
    | Rancher API Host          | The URL for your Rancher Server.                                              |
    | Private Key / Certificate | A key/certificate pair used for Assertion Encryption.                         |
    | Metadata XML              | The `Identity Provider metadata` file that you find in the application `Sign On` section.  |

    >**Tip:** You can generate a key/certificate pair using an openssl command. For example:
    >    
    >        openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.crt



1. After you complete the **Configure Okta Account** form, click **Enable**.

    Rancher redirects you to the IdP login page. Enter credentials that authenticate with Okta IdP to validate your Rancher Okta configuration.

    >**Note:** If nothing seems to happen, it's likely because your browser blocked the pop-up. Make sure you disable the pop-up blocker for your rancher domain and whitelist it in any other extensions you might utilize.

**Result:** Rancher is configured to work with Okta. Your users can now sign into Rancher using their Okta logins.
