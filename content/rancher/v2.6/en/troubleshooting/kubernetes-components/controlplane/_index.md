This section applies to nodes with the `controlplane` role.

# Check if the Controlplane Containers are Running

There are three specific containers launched on nodes with the `controlplane` role:

* `kube-apiserver`
* `kube-controller-manager`
* `kube-scheduler`

The containers should have status **Up**. The duration shown after **Up** is the time the container has been running.

```
docker ps -a -f=name='kube-apiserver|kube-controller-manager|kube-scheduler'
```

Example output:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```

# Controlplane Container Logging

> **Note:** If you added multiple nodes with the `controlplane` role, both `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` use a leader election process to determine the leader. Only the current leader will log the performed actions. See [Kubernetes leader election]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.6/en/troubleshooting/kubernetes-resources/#kubernetes-leader-election) how to retrieve the current leader.

The logging of the containers can contain information on what the problem could be.

```
docker logs kube-apiserver
docker logs kube-controller-manager
docker logs kube-scheduler
```
