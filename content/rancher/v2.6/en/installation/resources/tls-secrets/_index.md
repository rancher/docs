title: Adding TLS Secrets
weight: 2
---

Kubernetes will create all the objects and services for Rancher, but it will not become available until we populate the `tls-rancher-ingress` secret in the `cattle-system` namespace with the certificate and key.

Combine the server certificate followed by any intermediate certificate(s) needed into a file named `tls.crt`. Copy your certificate key into a file named `tls.key`.

For example, [acme.sh](https://acme.sh) provides server certificate and CA chains in `fullchain.cer` file. 
This `fullchain.cer` should be renamed to `tls.crt` & certificate key file as `tls.key`.

Use `kubectl` with the `tls` secret type to create the secrets.

```
kubectl -n cattle-system create secret tls tls-rancher-ingress \
  --cert=tls.crt \
  --key=tls.key
```

> **Note:** If you want to replace the certificate, you can delete the `tls-rancher-ingress` secret using `kubectl -n cattle-system delete secret tls-rancher-ingress` and add a new one using the command shown above. If you are using a private CA signed certificate, replacing the certificate is only possible if the new certificate is signed by the same CA as the certificate currently in use.

# Using a Private CA Signed Certificate

If you are using a private CA, Rancher requires a copy of the CA certificate which is used by the Rancher Agent to validate the connection to the server.

Copy the CA certificate into a file named `cacerts.pem` and use `kubectl` to create the `tls-ca` secret in the `cattle-system` namespace.

```
kubectl -n cattle-system create secret generic tls-ca \
  --from-file=cacerts.pem=./cacerts.pem
```

> **Note:** The configured `tls-ca` secret is retrieved when Rancher starts. On a running Rancher installation the updated CA will take effect after new Rancher pods are started.

# Updating a Private CA Certificate

Follow the steps on [this page]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/resources/update-ca-cert) to update the SSL certificate of the ingress in a Rancher [high availability Kubernetes installation]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/) or to switch from the default self-signed certificate to a custom certificate.
