1. Registered GKE and EKS clusters have the same options available as GKE and EKS clusters created from the Rancher UI. The  difference is that when a registered cluster is deleted from the Rancher UI, it is not destroyed.

2. Cluster configuration options can't be edited for registered clusters, except for [K3s and RKE2 clusters.]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/registered-clusters/)

3. For registered cluster nodes, the Rancher UI exposes the ability to cordon, drain, and edit the node.

4. For registered clusters using etcd as a control plane, snapshots must be taken manually outside of the Rancher UI to use for backup and recovery.
