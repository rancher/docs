title: CLI with Rancher
weight: 100
---

Interact with Rancher using command line interface (CLI) tools from your workstation.

## Rancher CLI

Follow the steps in [rancher cli](../../cli).

Ensure you can run `rancher kubectl get pods` successfully.


## kubectl
Install the `kubectl` utility. See [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).


Configure kubectl by visiting your cluster in the Rancher Web UI then clicking on `Kubeconfig`, copying contents and putting into your `~/.kube/config` file.

Run `kubectl cluster-info` or `kubectl get pods` successfully.

## Authentication with kubectl and kubeconfig Tokens with TTL

_Requirements_

If admins have [enforced TTL on kubeconfig tokens]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.6/en/api/api-tokens/#setting-ttl-on-kubeconfig-tokens), the kubeconfig file requires the [Rancher cli](../cli) to be present in your PATH when you run `kubectl`. Otherwise, youâ€™ll see error like: 
`Unable to connect to the server: getting credentials: exec: exec: "rancher": executable file not found in $PATH`. 

This feature enables kubectl to authenticate with the Rancher server and get a new kubeconfig token when required. The following auth providers are currently supported: 

1. Local
2. Active Directory
3. FreeIpa, OpenLdap 
4. SAML providers - Ping, Okta, ADFS, Keycloak, Shibboleth 

When you first run kubectl, for example, `kubectl get pods`, it will ask you to pick an auth provider and log in with the Rancher server. 
The kubeconfig token is cached in the path where you run kubectl under `./.cache/token`. This token is valid till [it expires](../../api/api-tokens/#setting-ttl-on-kubeconfig-tokens-period), or [gets deleted from the Rancher server](../../api/api-tokens/#deleting-tokens) 
Upon expiration, the next `kubectl get pods` will ask you to log in with the Rancher server again.
