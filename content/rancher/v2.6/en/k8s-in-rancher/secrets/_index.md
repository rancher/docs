[Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#overview-of-secrets) store sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or keys. They may contain one or more key value pairs.

> This page is about secrets in general. For details on setting up a private registry, refer to the section on [registries.]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.6/en/k8s-in-rancher/registries)

When configuring a workload, you'll be able to choose which secrets to include. Like config maps, secrets can be referenced by workloads as either an environment variable or a volume mount.

Mounted secrets will be updated automatically unless they are mounted as subpath volumes. For details on how updated secrets are propagated, refer to the [Kubernetes documentation.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#mounted-secrets-are-updated-automatically)

# Creating Secrets

1. In the upper left corner, click **â˜° > Cluster Management**.
1. Go to the cluster where you want to add a secret and click **Explore**.
1. Click **More Resources > Core > Secrets**.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Select the type of secret you want to create.
1. Select a **Namespace** for the secret.
1. Enter a **Name** for the secret.

    >**Note:** Kubernetes classifies secrets, certificates, and registries all as [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), and no two secrets in a project or namespace can have duplicate names. Therefore, to prevent conflicts, your secret must have a unique name among all secrets within your workspace.

1. From **Data**, click **Add** to add a key-value pair. Add as many values as you need.

    >**Tip:** You can add multiple key value pairs to the secret by copying and pasting.

1. Click **Save**.

**Result:** Your secret is added to the project or namespace, depending on the scope you chose. You can view the secret in the Rancher UI from the **Resources > Secrets** view.

Mounted secrets will be updated automatically unless they are mounted as subpath volumes. For details on how updated secrets are propagated, refer to the [Kubernetes documentation.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#mounted-secrets-are-updated-automatically)

# What's Next?

Now that you have a secret added to the project or namespace, you can add it to a workload that you deploy.

For more information on adding secret to a workload, see [Deploying Workloads]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.6/en/k8s-in-rancher/workloads/deploy-workloads/).
