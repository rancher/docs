Notifiers are services that inform you of alert events. You can configure notifiers to send alert notifications to staff best suited to take corrective action.

Rancher integrates with a variety of popular IT services, including:

- **Slack**: Send alert notifications to your Slack channels.
- **Email**: Choose email recipients for alert notifications.
- **PagerDuty**: Route notifications to staff by phone, SMS, or personal email.
- **WebHooks**: Update a webpage with alert notifications.
- **WeChat**: (Available as of v2.2.0) Send alert notifications to your Enterprise WeChat contacts.
- **DingTalk**: (Available as of v2.4.6) Send alert notifications to DingTalk using a webhook.
- **Microsoft Teams**: (Available as of v2.4.6) Send alert notifications to Teams using a webhook.

This section covers the following topics:

# Roles-based Access Control for Notifiers

Notifiers are configured at the cluster level. This model ensures that only cluster owners need to configure notifiers, leaving project owners to simply configure alerts in the scope of their projects. You don't need to dispense privileges like SMTP server access or cloud account access.

# Adding Notifiers

Set up a notifier so that you can begin configuring and sending alerts.

1. From the **Global View**, open the cluster that you want to add a notifier.
1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Notifiers**. Then click **Add Notifier**.
1. Select the service you want to use as your notifier, and then fill out the form. For help filling out the form, refer to the configuration section below.
1. Click **Test.** You should receive a notification confirming that the notifier is configured correctly.
1. Click **Add** to complete adding the notifier.

**Result:** Your notifier is added to Rancher.

# Managing Notifiers

After you set up notifiers, you can manage them. From the **Global** view, open the cluster that you want to manage your notifiers. Select **Tools > Notifiers**. You can:

- **Edit** their settings that you configured during their initial setup.
- **Clone** them, to quickly setup slightly different notifiers.
- **Delete** them when they're no longer necessary.
