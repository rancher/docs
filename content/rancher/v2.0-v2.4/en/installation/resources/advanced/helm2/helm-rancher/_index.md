Rancher installation is managed using the Helm package manager for Kubernetes.  Use `helm` to install the prerequisite and charts to install Rancher.

For systems without direct internet access, see [Air Gap: Kubernetes install]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/air-gap-installation/install-rancher/).

Refer to the [Helm version requirements]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/helm-version) to choose a version of Helm to install Rancher.

> **Note:** The installation instructions assume you are using Helm 2. The instructions will be updated for Helm 3 soon. In the meantime, if you want to use Helm 3, refer to [these instructions.](https://github.com/ibrokethecloud/rancher-helm3)

### Add the Helm Chart Repository

Use `helm repo add` command to add the Helm chart repository that contains charts to install Rancher. For more information about the repository choices and which is best for your use case, see [Choosing a Version of Rancher]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/resources/choosing-version).

{{< release-channel >}}

```
helm repo add rancher-<CHART_REPO> https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/<CHART_REPO>
```

### Choose your SSL Configuration

Rancher Server is designed to be secure by default and requires SSL/TLS configuration.

There are three recommended options for the source of the certificate.

> **Note:** If you want terminate SSL/TLS externally, see [TLS termination on an External Load Balancer]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/helm2/helm-rancher/chart-options/#external-tls-termination).

| Configuration | Chart option | Description | Requires cert-manager |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| [Rancher Generated Certificates](#rancher-generated-certificates) | `ingress.tls.source=rancher` | Use certificates issued by Rancher's generated CA (self signed)<br/>This is the **default** | [yes](#optional-install-cert-manager) |
| [Let’s Encrypt](#let-s-encrypt) | `ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt` | Use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue a certificate | [yes](#optional-install-cert-manager) |
| [Certificates from Files](#certificates-from-files) | `ingress.tls.source=secret` | Use your own certificate files by creating Kubernetes Secret(s) | no |

### Optional: Install cert-manager

**Note:** cert-manager is only required for certificates issued by Rancher's generated CA (`ingress.tls.source=rancher`) and Let's Encrypt issued certificates (`ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt`). You should skip this step if you are using your own certificate files (option `ingress.tls.source=secret`) or if you use [TLS termination on an External Load Balancer]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/helm2/helm-rancher/chart-options/#external-tls-termination).

> **Important:**
> Due to an issue with Helm v2.12.0 and cert-manager, please use Helm v2.12.1 or higher.

> Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade. If you are upgrading Rancher and using a version of cert-manager older than v0.12.0, please see our [upgrade documentation]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/upgrading-cert-manager/).

Rancher relies on [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) to issue certificates from Rancher's own generated CA or to request Let's Encrypt certificates.

These instructions are adapted from the [official cert-manager documentation](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/install/kubernetes.html#installing-with-helm).


1. Install the CustomResourceDefinition resources separately
    ```plain
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/release-0.9/deploy/manifests/00-crds.yaml
    ```

1. Create the namespace for cert-manager
    ```plain
    kubectl create namespace cert-manager
    ```

1. Label the cert-manager namespace to disable resource validation
    ```plain
    kubectl label namespace cert-manager certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true
    ```

1. Add the Jetstack Helm repository
    ```plain
    helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
    ```

1. Update your local Helm chart repository cache
    ```plain
    helm repo update
    ```

1. Install the cert-manager Helm chart
    ```plain
    helm install \
      --name cert-manager \
      --namespace cert-manager \
      --version v0.14.2 \
      jetstack/cert-manager
    ```

Once you’ve installed cert-manager, you can verify it is deployed correctly by checking the cert-manager namespace for running pods:

```
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager

NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-7cbdc48784-rpgnt                   1/1     Running     0          3m
cert-manager-webhook-5b5dd6999-kst4x            1/1     Running     0          3m
cert-manager-cainjector-3ba5cd2bcd-de332x       1/1     Running     0          3m
```

If the ‘webhook’ pod (2nd line) is in a ContainerCreating state, it may still be waiting for the Secret to be mounted into the pod. Wait a couple of minutes for this to happen but if you experience problems, please check the [troubleshooting](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/troubleshooting.html) guide.

#### Rancher Generated Certificates

> **Note:** You need to have [cert-manager](#optional-install-cert-manager) installed before proceeding.

The default is for Rancher to generate a CA and uses `cert-manager` to issue the certificate for access to the Rancher server interface. Because `rancher` is the default option for `ingress.tls.source`, we are not specifying `ingress.tls.source` when running the `helm install` command.

- Set the `hostname` to the DNS name you pointed at your load balancer.
- If you are installing an alpha version, Helm requires adding the `--devel` option to the command. 

```
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org
```

Wait for Rancher to be rolled out:

```
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

#### Let's Encrypt

> **Note:** You need to have [cert-manager](#optional-install-cert-manager) installed before proceeding.

This option uses `cert-manager` to automatically request and renew [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates. This is a free service that provides you with a valid certificate as Let's Encrypt is a trusted CA. This configuration uses HTTP validation (`HTTP-01`) so the load balancer must have a public DNS record and be accessible from the internet.

- Set `hostname` to the public DNS record, set `ingress.tls.source` to `letsEncrypt` and `letsEncrypt.email` to the email address used for communication about your certificate (for example, expiry notices)
- If you are installing an alpha version, Helm requires adding the `--devel` option to the command. 

```
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt \
  --set letsEncrypt.email=me@example.org
```

Wait for Rancher to be rolled out:

```
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

#### Certificates from Files

Create Kubernetes secrets from your own certificates for Rancher to use.


> **Note:** The `Common Name` or a `Subject Alternative Names` entry in the server certificate must match the `hostname` option, or the ingress controller will fail to configure correctly. Although an entry in the `Subject Alternative Names` is technically required, having a matching `Common Name` maximizes compatibility with older browsers/applications. If you want to check if your certificates are correct, see [How do I check Common Name and Subject Alternative Names in my server certificate?]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/faq/technical/#how-do-i-check-common-name-and-subject-alternative-names-in-my-server-certificate)

- Set `hostname` and set `ingress.tls.source` to `secret`.
- If you are installing an alpha version, Helm requires adding the `--devel` option to the command. 

```
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=secret
```

If you are using a Private CA signed certificate , add `--set privateCA=true` to the command:

```
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=secret
  --set privateCA=true
```

Now that Rancher is deployed, see [Adding TLS Secrets]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/helm2/helm-rancher/tls-secrets/) to publish the certificate files so Rancher and the ingress controller can use them.

After adding the secrets, check if Rancher was rolled out successfully:

```
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
```

If you see the following error: `error: deployment "rancher" exceeded its progress deadline`, you can check the status of the deployment by running the following command:

```
kubectl -n cattle-system get deploy rancher
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
rancher   3         3         3            3           3m
```

It should show the same count for `DESIRED` and `AVAILABLE`.

### Advanced Configurations

The Rancher chart configuration has many options for customizing the install to suit your specific environment. Here are some common advanced scenarios.

* [HTTP Proxy]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/chart-options/)
* [Private Docker Image Registry]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/chart-options/#private-registry-and-air-gap-installs)
* [TLS Termination on an External Load Balancer]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/helm2/helm-rancher/chart-options/#external-tls-termination)

See the [Chart Options]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/options/helm2/helm-rancher/chart-options/) for the full list of options.

### Save your options

Make sure you save the `--set` options you used. You will need to use the same options when you upgrade Rancher to new versions with Helm.

### Finishing Up

That's it you should have a functional Rancher server. Point a browser at the hostname you picked and you should be greeted by the colorful login page.
