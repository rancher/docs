# Creating a Custom Cluster

## Objectives

{{< prereq_cluster >}}

1.	[Create a Linux Host](#create-a-linux-host)

	Begin by provisioning a Linux host.

2. [Create the Cluster](#create-the-custom-cluster)

	Use your new Linux host as a template for your new Kubernetes cluster.

## Provision a Linux Host

Begin creation of a custom cluster by provisioning a Linux host. Your host can be:

- A cloud-host virtual machine (VM)
- An on-premise VM
- A bare-metal server

Provision the host according to our [requirements](../setup/requirements.md).

>**Bare-Metal Server Note:**
>
While creating your cluster, you must assign Kubernetes roles to your cluster nodes. If you plan on dedicating bare-metal servers to each role, you must provision a bare-metal server for each role (i.e. provision multiple bare-metal servers).

## Create the Custom Cluster

Use {{< product >}} to clone your Linux host and configure them as Kubernetes nodes.

1. From the **Clusters** page, click **Add Cluster**.

2. Choose **Custom**.

3. Enter a **Cluster Name**.

4. {{< step_create-cluster_member-roles >}}

5. {{< step_create-cluster_cluster-options >}}

6.	Click **Next**.

7.	From **Node Role**, choose the roles that you want filled by a cluster node.

	>**Bare-Metal Server Reminder:**
	>
	If you plan on dedicating bare-metal servers to each role, you must provision a bare-metal server for each role (i.e. provision multiple bare-metal servers).

8.	**Optional**: Use **Labels** to add metadata so that you can find them later.

9. Copy the command displayed on screen to your clipboard.

10. Log in to your Linux host using your preferred shell, such as PuTTy or a remote Terminal connection. Run the command copied to your clipboard.

	>**Note:** Repeat steps 7-10 if you want to dedicate specific hosts to specific node roles. Repeat the steps as many times as needed.

11. When you finish running the command(s) on your Linux host(s), click **Done**.
