# Updating the {{< product >}} Server URL

The first time that you log into {{< product >}}, the system prompts for the {{< product >}} Server URL, which is the IP address or host name that your Kubernetes nodes register with.

If you need to update this URL, select **Settings** from the **Global** view.

### When Should I Update the {{< product >}} Server URL?

If URL of your {{< product >}} Server changes, you must update the {{< product >}} Server URL so that your nodes can continue communication with the {{< product >}} Server.
